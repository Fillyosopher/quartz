Welcome to my little blog / idea garden / containment space.
I have a bad habit of overwhelming people with too many thoughts in a given period.
I've tried many different methods to get my thoughts down somewhere that could be consumed asynchronously.
More importantly, I /need/ note taking for my own sanity, as I have lingering memory issues after a decade of suicidal depression.
As such, future me is the primary audience, but what's fit for future me may also be fit for others :)
