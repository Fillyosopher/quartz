Welcome to my little blog / idea garden / containment space.

I have a bad habit of overwhelming people with too many thoughts in a given period.

I've tried many different methods to get my thoughts down somewhere that could be consumed asynchronously.

More importantly, I *need* note taking for my own sanity, as I have lingering memory issues after a decade of suicidal depression.

(Hell, I've been using singular pronouns here, but that's [[drafts/Plural History|Not Entirely Accurate]])

As such, future me is the primary audience, but what's fit for future me may also be fit for others :)
