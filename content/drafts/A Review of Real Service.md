Real Service is a book by [Raven Kaldera](https://ravenkaldera.org/) discussing long-running service relationship dynamics.  Originally, this page was an Outline of the book. But I found it much more useful to structure this into a list of the Core Models of the work. The result is not in quite the same order that the book presents things.

# Core Models

## Service Motivations

- Transactional
  - Motivated for service by the expectation of reciprocation
  - EG, I'll do X because I know I'll get Y later
  - Pro: keeps a s-type from being taken advantage of
  - Con: M-type partner becomes somewhat interchangeable/not special
  - Con: s-type behavior dissipates when not rewarded, making it not suitable for 24/7 service
- Devotional
  - Motivated for service by direct love, desire to support
  - EG, I'll do X because Y needs it and I love them
  - Pro: M-type partner is special and unique
  - Con: s-type can be taken advantage of if they love an abuser
  - Con: s-type behavior dependant on feelings, making it not suitable for lifelong service
- Positional
  - Motivated for service by personal identity
  - EG, I'll do X because that's who I am
  - Pro: s-type behavior is unconditional, lifelong
  - Con: M-type partner becomes somewhat interchangeable/not special
  - Con: s-type can be taken advantage of their only outlets for service are abusive

## Styles of Service

- Reactive vs Active vs Proactive
- Reactive
  - focus on immediate obedience
  - Does not act without prompting
  - Can become incredibly literal over time, requiring more and more specific prompting
  - Pro: can be used to train out be habits of trying to "do it better"
- Active
  - Uses Standing Orders rather than individual direction
  - Ideally, happens after a servant is familiar with their master's methods, preferences, etc
  - Should have a strong model of master in their head, and often think "What Would Master Want?"
- Proactive
  - Also called Anticipatory Service
  - Attempt to guess "What Would Master Want?" to pleasantly surprise them
  - Requires lengthy observation and storing Theory of Mind to pull off
  - Important not to penalize Master for disliking anticipatory service
  - Important to back of anticipatory service and refocus on studying each time it fails

## Styles of Dominance

Parental vs Celebrity

- Parental Example
  - Master drives the car, the slave may not even know where they're going
  - Master takes the menus and orders for both
  - Master decides when they are finished and pays, because slaves don't handle money
- Celebrity Example
  - The slave chauffeurs the master to a preferred restaurant
  - The slave walks in, grabs the table that master wants, and orders for them both
  - The slave pays for the meal, because the master has better things to do than fret about money
- Parental: High Control, Low Service
  - Often involves Reactive service
  - The biggest service is being obedient
  - It's important to align with partners here; a servant who loves proactive service may feel they are being treated as incompetent
- Celebrity: High Service, Low Control
  - Active, and often Proactive service
  - The biggest service is saving master time
  - It's important to align with partners here; a servant who loves being controlled may feel abandoned'

## 3 Levels of Servant Skill

- Remedial: it's reasonable to assume any competent adult can do these
- Basic: Would be expected of more servants who routinely provide service
- Advanced: Specialized skills that wouldn't be expected, but might be on offer given strong aptitude, specific training, or extensive study

## 3 Levels of Instruction Detail

- Detailed: make few assumptions about prior knowledge, do not require complex decisions, make it /difficult/ to fail if followed. The master knows exactly how to do the task. The master is taking responsibility for verifying the servant knows exactly what to do. The servant asks few questions due to the few gaps in the instructions.
- Basic: assume previous or relevant related knowledge, and can make decisions when instructions have gaps. The master may know exactly how to do the task, just a general idea. The master has a specific result in mind. The servant asks questions only where the intended result is unclear or there is a significant gap in the instructions.
- Minimal: assumes the servant is familiar with all aspects of service. The servant may be making complex decisions regarding methods. The master may have little understanding of how the service is performed, and only a general idea of the desired outcome. The servant asks few questions regarding the details, instead clarifying the intended goal. If the master requests things without understanding repercussions, it is the servant's responsibility to inform the master. The servant is responsible for determining the outcome is desirable.

### Extra Definitions

Without Prompting:

- Means that once an order is given, it is carried out without reminders /from the master/
- External reminders are most likely allowed and encouraged
- A reminder from the master should never be relied upon
- for Active and Proactive servants, with Standing Orders or Anticipatory Service
Reasonable Manner:
- Occasionally, due to different upbringings or context, a master and servant may be misaligned in their understandings
- These should be corrected with clearer communication on the first instance, and treated as any other mistake on the second instance.

## Annoyance

This is not a chapter of a book, but is a core point spread across it that needs to be better stated.

Annoyance: a core emotion by which Masters discovers an opportunity for service.

Annoyance is how you notice spots in your Routine where a servant could make things run easier.
A Task is only worth training on if, when the servant performs that task, it reduces your annoyance.
Annoyance is the emotion you will feel when a task was not complete. It lets you know when to provide further instruction or disciple. Tasks which do not reduce Annoyance will be easily forgotten by both Master and servant.
Reduction in Annoyance is how you evaluate the worth of a Servant. It is how you locate avenues of praise.
"Service" which annoys you is not Service at all. Never accept "Service" which adds new Annoyance under any circumstance. It is dishonest to your servant and a failure of your role.
Certain emotional communication, eg nagging or bitterness, are highly likely to evoke annoyance. God servants should endeavor to remove these from their language, and good master should train against that behavior.

# Secondary Notes

## Joshua's Rules of Service

- First Rule of Service: If the master doesn't want it, it isn't service.
  - This doesn't preclude it being "good" in some sense, but don't mistake that for service.
  - mis-aligned service can pressure an M-type into accepting service they don't want
  - M-types accepting service they don't want has many bad consequences
    - It's dishonest to their s-type
    - It assumes the s-type can't handle correction
    - It assumes the s-type isn't worth training
    - It deprives the s-type of any chance to improve
    - It causes the s-type to waste time, both immediately and in the future
    - It means the M-type isn't actually in charge. Either the s-types emotions, or the M-types fears are in charge.
  - There are many ways to correct mis-aligned service
    - Correct M-type fears: s-types do not want low expectations
    - Correct s-type emotions: provide support if needed
    - Correct s-type's knowledge: explain and redirect their service desires
- Second Rule of Service: Contempt has no place in service.
  - Contempt, in either direction, weakens the relationship
  - M-type contempt for an s-type: shows a lack of security in their role. A true M-type is confident in their ability to direct.
  - A good servant is something to be respect as a valuable resource and skilled worker doing what they enjoy.
  - s-type contempt for an M-type: shows a lack of security in their role. A true s-type is confident their M-type can direct.
  - Beware shadenfreud when your M-type fails or shows incompitance.
- Third Rule of Service: a bad attitude is corrosive to both servant and relationship
  - Many people in service positions are forced there, explaining any bad attitude. But a consensual servant does not have this excuse.
  - Bitterness and sulking are a stress release, which indicates perhaps the s-type does not desire to do service.
  - Over time, the association between service and bitterness can taint the whole.
  - If possible, replace bitterness with a striving for excellence in every task.
- Fourth Rule of Service: a good servant wants their master to be right.
  - There is a common dilemma in a s-type's life: wanting to be Right versus wanting to be Obediant.
  - Disagreements between master and servant will happen.
  - When they do, a good servant does the following
    - make a respectful attempt to correct
    - follow the request given, whether it has changed or not, to the best of your ability
    - decide once and for all if the master is incompetent to an extreme length (putting others in danger).
    - If they are not, relax and let go. Recenter. You want them to be right. Try to make it so.

## Annoyance Factor

- It is the M-type's responsibility to checkup, assess, and enforce.
- Mistake is exepecially common when transitioning from part-time/scene-oriented service to full-time/live-in dynamic.
- Scenes are high-intensity D/s, Live-in are by necessaity not that.
- For M-types: pick tasks which, when they aren't done, give you noticable annoyance. These are the things you can reinforce easily.
- Don't fall for tasks which look good in a scene but might slip unnoticed by you. It is bad to give your servant a task that you cannot even remember to train them on.
- Good Idea: Servant picks out two meals, the master can eat either or from both, the servant can finish whatever isn't chosen.
- Work on one rule at a time, find out if it will stay, then move on.
- (From later in the book) Do not pick tasks for which no amount of service can remove your annoyance.

### Optimizing for Priorities

- Sometimes, tasks will be done differently than expected
- Usually, this is a difference in Priority
  - EG "Why do you take this less efficient path?" "It brings me joy"
  - Literally just Color Model
- Many issues of Priority will be so minor as to be ignorable
- Master-side: if they continue to do it their way, will it cease to be service
- Servant-side: No one is going to die if I do things Master's way
- It is important, early in a relationship, that the Master always take a Blue tone, so as not to through Purple signals give the wrong impression. Only later, once communication and trust is built, can Purple be shown without disrupting requests.

### For Masters: Integrating the Servant Into the Routine

- It is insecure to want complete self-sufficiency or to avoid "becoming dependant on someone"
- "I am better at X, why should I allow Y to do it?"
  - You are the Master. You choose the tasks. If no quality of service would fix your Annoyance, then it is not an appropriate task.
  - Even masters of a craft can find monotonous portions of work which they can offload
- On generating tasks for your servant
  - Do your normal routine and write down each time you become annoyed. These are places your servant might be able to assist you.
  - Visualize how your servant would fit into the situation. Do they have the requisite skill and attitude? Remember that a good servant may benefit from seeing your process (especially Proactive types)
  - Slowly integrate them into the process. It's okay for them to start by doing little. Point out your annoyances, show them how to assist when those occur. If, after thorough consideration, they can't help? Drop the idea.
  - Do not feel pressure to accomidate a servant's desire to change the process to be easier for them. Be honest, with yourself and your servant, in evaluating any suggestions.
  - Do not accept inconveniences: remember that annoyance indicates a desire for service. Service itself should never evoke annoyance.

Assisting when Master can't define the final state (chapter name For Servants: Minimally Invasive Organizing)

- Start by observing the current workflow. What is use commonly, with high urgency, or often browsed.
- Ask about preferences, try to uncover the underlying system and categories

### Correcting Problematic Behavior

- In scene play, not following an order is a most an annoyance. But for 24/7 servants, forgetting to pick up a child or buy food can have real world and significant consequences beyond master's displeasure.
- No one is perfect. Account for true accidents. Set an acceptible margin for each task.
- In general, long-term servants do not respond well to "punishment". They take pride and stake some of their identity on their tasks. The only time punishment makes sense is an instantaneous response to correct habitual behavior, as explicit operant conditioning.
The recommendations:
  - Bring the servant's attention to the situation
  - verify that the problem is understood
  - Determine why the problem occurred
  - Develop a plan for preventing this problem in the future
  - If necessary, re-evaluate the servant's capabilities
- When failures persist, the best approach is to durastically reduce expectations of competance, slowly build back up from there. Make the task painfully simple, add complexity only one the simple has been completely mastered
  - For emotionally sensative servant, can help develop confidence
  - For less emotionally sensitive, mild humiliation can be incorporated. (Use strategies for teaching children)
  - For reluctant servants, or those who want to be forced, making the simple task monotonous will cause more complex tasks to feel like a relief.

### Remedial Obedience

- Some s-types could make good servants, but for one reason or another aren't ready
  - Perhaps attached to the fantasy of the role
  - Bad habits from past relationships/dysfunctional unbringing
  - Some are not sufficiently mature (whatever their age)
  - Some have poor self-control
- It is uncommon for an normal, well-adjusted adult to require any kind of obedience training.
- Escapist Servants:
  - If a servant can hold a job or similar, but cannot perform in a power dynamic, it is likely because they are in a fantasy role, or see the service as an escape.
  - It may take work to find service they can do which allows them to stay in role or doesn't feel like work
- PTSD Servants:
  - Expect significant effort
  - A structured controlled training environment with a restricted role can help
  - Slowly expand their privledges of being useful, using their own judgement, and expressing their opinion
- Not all bad behavior can be caused by Remedial Obediance
  - Separate bad behavior into "misdemeanors" and "felonies"
  - Misdemeanors can be addressed with skillful training, felonies leave little hope of establishing a service relationship
  - Misdemeanors should be responded to with a serious conversation about the reasons for their behavior and their commitment to the relationship.
  - Misdemeanors are signs that something is fundimentally amiss.
  - Felonies deserve a hard look at whether the relationship can continue in any sense.
 (what follows is a list of Misdemeanors and Felonies. I can't summarize it while doing it justice)

### Questioning Orders and Disagreeing With Respect

- In any long-lasting relationships, no matter how devotional, the servant will notice areas the have more knowledge, skill, or insight.
- In a mature relationship, a servant is able to offer advice and contrary opinions respectfully.
- Offering opinions /frequently/ is only for experiences and trusted servants. It is not unhealthy to restrict a right to voice opinion until earned.
- For inexperienced and insecure servants, offering advice can create a no-win situation for the matter
  - If they take the advice and it fails, the servant feels the master can't decide.
  - If they don't take the advice but succeed, he servant may be sullen about being proven wrong.
  - If they don't take the advice and it fails, the servant feels "I told you so" that can undermine future interactions.
  - If they're prohibited from offering advice, they may feel abused or that the master is insecure.
- Give feedback respectfully. State information that may have been missed. "May I offer an alternative?"
- The master must always feel empowered to say no to changes and requests.
- The master should decide if the servant's advice is a valuable tool or not, and restrict or permit it accordingly.
- Asking for help
  - Servants should differentiate between Emergency and Non-emergency situations with explicit language
- Communicating Emotions
  - One option is Strict Phrases: eg "Yes, Sir" for no emotion, "If it pleases you, sir" for dislike, "Only if it pleases you, sir" for distaste.
- Accidental Orders
  - It is good to explicitly flag orders.
    - Master may use a specific phrase, but this is onerous.
    - Servant always responds "Yes, Sir" to percieved orders, giving their master a change to intercept, is often better.

### Gender and Service

- Some relationships utilize traditional gender roles
  - Can be used to punish, by assigning explicitly "other gender" work
  - Can be used to reward, by assigning explicitly gender-affirming work
  - Can be used to reinforce or breach identity
  - May be eroticized
  - Might be expected by s-types
