Relating Languages is a model of language between people. As an autistic person with decades of refining my masks, I find this concept fascinating. One of the problems I had, growing up, was a lack of explicit instruction about how communication works. I made a study of it, and developed a few models of my own. However, my models have always struggled to categorize the encoded aspects of communication, and that where Relating Languages shines.

In this Review, I'm going to attempt a summary of Relating Language Overview, a free document from <https://www.relatinglanguages.com>. Afterward, I'm going to dig deeper into each portion of the model, to see what is intuitive or counter intuitive for me.

## Model Overview

### 3 Axis of Relating Languages

- **Receptive - Expressive Axis**: This axis indicates the amount of Proactivity in one's speech patterns. A Receptive communicator is more likely to be waiting for a prompt or handing over (give) turns, while an Expressive communicator is more likely to initiate conversation or take over the turn.
- **Interactive - Didactic Axis**: This axis indicates the length of turns during an interaction. An Interactive communicator tends toward high frequency turn-taking, keeping alignment with the listener through constant checks and short feedback loops. Meanwhile a Didactic communicator tends toward longer high content turns, keeping alignment with the listener through fully explaining before handing off speaking role.
- **External - Internal Axis**: This axis indicates how much the speaker is focusing on themselves or their listener. While not used for the Quadrants, this axis is used to differentiate the 8 base languages. Meanwhile the 4 Balanced Languages sit in the middle of this axis, balancing both sides.

I definitely feel like I struggle most with the Expressive mode, of the 4 poles.

### 4 Quadrants of Relating Languages

- **Questioning**: A communication style focused around asking questions and fulfilling one’s curiosity.  A “Receptive and Interactive” mode, meaning short turns with explicit handovers. Keeping a balanced pace to keep engagement high.
- **Directing**: A communication style focused around giving recommendations or orders. A “Interactive and Expressive” mode, meaning short turns with intuited handovers. Quick and concise enough to get things decided.*
- **Storytelling**: A communication style focused around relaying information.  A “Didactic and Expressive” mode, meaning long turns with intuited handovers. Plenty of time to really sell the events while still letting others.*
- **Observing**: A communication style focused around Receiving information.  A “Didactic and Receptive” mode, meaning long turns with explicit handovers. Plenty of time to think about what was said!

\* And here, I notice again that my lack of understanding of the Expressive mode makes it a bit more difficult to describe the benefits/considerations of Directing and Storytelling. Both are *clearly* important, equally to the others! But I really struggled to simplify them enough in my head to write those last summary sentences. The "with intuited handovers" feels... not quite right. Looks like some work yet to be done for me.

### 3 Dialects of Relating Languages

- **Balanced Dialect**: These dialects represent the highest-skill form of a Quadrant's communication style. They are the combination of an Internal and External Dialect, balancing the self-focus and other-focus aspects of those two into something which serves the needs of both participants.
- **Internal Dialect**: Self-focused Dialects, with one for each of the Quadrants. They focus heavily on one's own motivations and interest, which can cause them to quickly lose other's interest. In Relating Languages, these are considered a bad form of communication.
- **External Dialect**: Other-focused Dialects,

This entire section reminds me HEAVILY of [[drafts/Model of Relationship Optimization|Model of Relationship Optimization]]! Internal Dialects are a GREAT indicator of Bad Egoism, while External Dialects are a similarly great indicator of Bad Altruism.

This section is also lays out an implicit growth path for someone using Relating Languages as a learning tool. If you are good at an External Dialect, then learn the Internal Dialect and weave it into your conversation to create a Balanced Dialect. and vice versa. I love Models that treat themselves as Skills, but I usually prefer every combination of poles be a "good skill", where Relating Languages treats the middle of the External - Internal Axis as optimal. Not my preference but still completely functional.

### 3 Questioning Dialects

- **Serving**: This is the External Dialect of Questioning, the Receptive and Interactive quadrant. Serving is about learning the other person and making them feel seen.
- **Interrogating**: This is the Internal Dialect of Questioning, the Receptive and Interactive quadrant. Interrogating is about learning what you want to know, and satisfying your own curiosity.
- **Exploring/Inviting**:  This is the Balanced Dialect of Questioning, the Receptive and Interactive quadrant. Inviting is about balancing your desire to know with the other person's desire for validation. This Dialect is called both Exploring and Inviting in the literature.

### 3 Observing Dialects

- **Merging**: This is the External Dialect of Observing, the Receptive and Didactic quadrant. Merging is about fitting into the vibe, including saying whatever keeps everyone unsurprised/interrupted when prompted while keeping the focus off you, getting washed up in the thoughts of others.
- **Withdrawing**: This is the Internal Dialect of Observing, the Receptive and Didactic quadrant. Withdrawing is about disengaging and staying aloof, keeping your reactions to yourself so as not to disrupt, and focusing on your own thoughts.
- **Partaking**:  This is the Balanced Dialect of Observing, the Receptive and Didactic quadrant. Partaking is about being present and observant, ready to comment when the time is right with no pressure to do so, hearing others without losing track of your own opinions and voice.

### 3 Storytelling Dialects

- **Performing**: This is the External Dialect of Storytelling, the Expressive and Didactic quadrant. Performing is about watching the reactions of others as you speak, trying to keep their focus and engagement, even to the point of altering your message/story.
- **Informing**: This is the Internal Dialect of Storytelling, the Expressive and Didactic quadrant. Informing is about completely and fully expressing yourself and making Sure that others understand.
- **Conveying**:  This is the Balanced Dialect of Storytelling, the Expressive and Didactic quadrant. Conveying is about being able to fully get across the information you need, the full story, without

### 3 Directing Dialects

- **Suggesting**: This is the External Dialect of Interactive, the Expressive and Interactive quadrant. Suggesting is about applying the minimum pressure while still inviting others to change.
- **Commanding**: This is the Internal Dialect of Interactive, the Expressive and Interactive quadrant. Commanding is about applying the maximum of pressure, often from a personal desire standpoint, in order to get someone to change.
- **Conducting**:  This is the Balanced Dialect of Interactive, the Expressive and Interactive quadrant. Conducting is about being clear with your desires, while leaving room for counter-offers, contributions, and collaboration.

### Secondary Model: 3 Language Niche

The 3 Language Niche are mentioned in amore offhand way in the Overview document, and are not a core lens of the model.

- **Safety Language**: The Quadrant or Dialects you use around friends and in safe places.  What you Default to when not intentionally masking. Your [[drafts/Genuine vs Authentic|Genuine]] Language.
- **Stress Language**: The Quadrant or Dialects you use when threatened or unsafe. What you Default to when under strain or in high Noradrenaline states.
- **Social Language**: "Change depending on the context of the group." It's a bit unclear from the document what Social Language means.

My best guess is that Social Language means your [[drafts/Genuine vs Authentic|Authentic]] mode of speaking, the kind you are trying out or learning.  But I could be completely off base

## Review

### Overall

I love this model, and will likely be using a modified form of it going forward for my Mental Health Coaching. It has incredible documentation already, which makes it useful as a starting point when trying to establish common terms with someone.

### Another Pill for Typical Mind Fallacy

One of the biggest problems I see people running into is small scale [Typical Mind Fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/typical-mind-fallacy).  The way this plays out is one person has a limited amount of communication experience and assumes that experience is the default.  Other people start to look like "broken" versions of themself... which is a rather anti-social lens to use.

Relating Languages provides an alternate lens: there are many Dialects people use when Relating to others! Treating your preferred version as either perfect or the only option is a recipe for misunderstanding.  It's three axis represent the different ways preferences people have for their speech: how long are the turns, how are they passed, and who is the focus.

By learning the sheer variety of ways others talk, you can start to educate yourself about [[drafts/Normal is who you meet|what is Normal]]. By watching people use a different speaking mode, you can dismantle your assumptions about effective communication and see the broader field of options.  By looking internally, you can find what skills you lack and develop a practice plan for growth.

### Expressive-Receptive Axis and the hidden Speaker-Listener skill Axis

This section relies on an assumption.  The assumption is this: "You should attempt to use the same Dialect as your speaking partner by default."  To be clear, this assumption is not explicitly stated by the Relating Languages Overview!  There are hints of it though: the name [dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect) itself implies that different Relating Languages are "mutually intelligible", but as someone who has moved around a lot I can tell you that mirroring the local dialect always helps smooth communication.

To be clear, this might not be the author's intent at all.  This might be me smuggling in a concept from Color Model and assuming it applies here.  Still, if we go forward with that assumption, that two people using the same RL Dialect will communicate better than those using two different Dialects... we hit on an interesting problem.  It seems like the authors themselves tend to conflate Expressive with Speaking and Receptive with Listening... when there are fairly obvious skillsets around "Expressive Listening" and "Receptive Speaking".

For example, based on their descriptions, RL would expect a Storytelling communicator to want an Observing Audience. All of the words used for Storytelling seem to imply they're the center of attention, constantly talking, while the wording of Observing implies active listening with few words said. But that breaks with the concept of Mirroring Dialect; couldn't a Storyteller want a Storytelling audience?

Lets dig into that. A Storyteller is taking their long turn, spelling out the major events of the story... while the audience does what? If the Audience is made up Observers, they will be silent and listen until the end. That doesn't sound like a very Expressive interaction! Expressive interactions are supposed to have people taking over the turn informally!

In my experience, what a group of Storytellers actually do is have one tell their story while others chime in with extra little details, asides, and quirks. Never quite interrupting the primary flow, but instead adding to it quickly. The audience certainly isn't SILENT. Mirroring the speaker's Storytelling energy involves adding in!

To me, it's just obvious that Storytelling(and the other quadrants) involve TWO SKILLS. There is the Storytelling Speaker, and there is the Storytelling Listener. The Storytelling speaker expects and allows for interruptions, despite the long turns, and the Storytelling listener expects to be able to add on even while listening. A crowd of Storytellers create a story cooperatively, despite having one lead. It might even be a faux pas to /not/ interact with the story in any way, to be a complete Observer with nothing to say, no banter to contribute. (Can you tell I've made this mistake before?)

I think the model could use this additional Speaker-Listener axis, although I can understand it being missing from the overview. It would add a fourth dimension, and that's just too much for more people to use when they're just learning a new model!  Starting with less axis is good... but having the option of finer-grained analysis and skills is also good.  

As a personal example, I'm quite good at "Directing"... as a listener. I know how to accept suggestions and respond to them without giving suggestions in return. And that skill has not made me *any* better at Directing as a speaker, something I'm not rapidly trying to learn because of my new job role.  Knowing the difference helps me isolate what skills I need to practice.

### External-Internal Axis and BDSM

What I find most interesting about the External-Internal Axis and how the poles of each map near-perfectly to BDSM speech expectations.  Yes, Balanced Dialect is framed (correctly) as the standard for the vast majority of interactions. Egalitarian communication is the default culture and Balanced Dialects match those expectations perfects. But the poles of the External-Internal Axis so accurately map to "Dom" and "Sub" communication tropes that you could use them as a guide.  Given the author notes BDSM as a source of inspiration, I'm certain this is not a mistake in the model, but it still tickles me to see.

It's to the point that I would honestly consider Relating Languages as a follow-up to [[drafts/A Review of Real Service|Real Service]] for people looking to have long running Relationship Dynamics.  And definitely for Polyamorous people who need to be able to switch Dialect based on which partner they're talking with.

#### The "Good" Dialects of Relating Languages

- Exploring: Egalitarian way of questioning.
- Partaking: Egalitarian way of observing.
- Conveying: Egalitarian way of storytelling.
- Conducting: Egalitarian way of directing.

#### The "Bad" Dialects of Relating Languages

- Interrogating: Dom way of questioning.
- Withdrawing: Dom way of observing.
- Informing: Dom way of storytelling.
- Commanding: Dom way of directing.

- Serving: Sub way of questioning.
- Merging: Sub way of observing.
- Performing: Sub way of storytelling.
- Suggesting: Sub way of directing.

### Color Model and Relating Languages

To open, I don't think that Color Model and Relating Languages map one to one. The way I think of it, during the listening Process, Relating Languages happen a bit before the Color Model during decoding. Relating Languages are more around how the message is framed and presented, Color Model is more about what internal representations are used as message content. Another way to say it is that RL is a bit more to the Syntax side while Color Model is a bit more to the Semantics side.

Because of this, I don't think there's any reason to believe that, say, Yellow Thinkers are automatically better at Commanding Dialect. Hypothetically, the two should be completely independent. That said, reviewing my experiences, there is some overlap or association between the two. Keep in mind, I'm writing this having only been introduced to RL 24 hours ago, so these associations are built from an intuitive understanding of RL and not time-honed practice with it.

- **Yellow** (External Thinking): I most associate Yellow with Interrogating and Commanding, making them fit into the Interactive Internal axis of RL. Yellow wants to efficiently understand, correct, and move on. Internally, this feels like optimizing toward a goal or end state.
- **Pink** (External Feeling): I most associate Pink with Suggesting and Serving, making them fit into the Interactive External axis of RL. Pink wants to gently push everyone into a comfortable and cooperative state. It could be that most Pink people I interact with simply prefer slower paced communication styles! This makes them the RL External opposite to Yellow!
- **Red** (External Sensing): I most associate with Performing and Merging, making them fit into External Didactic axis of RL. Red wants to show off for others and fit in with the crowd, looking for predictability in hierarchy while using symbols to establish roles/relationships.
- **Orange** (External Intuiting): I most associate with Interrogating and Informing, making them not quite fit in RL, although both Dialects are Internal. Orange wants to deeply understand the world, and to share the models it forms via that curiosity. It's Storytelling is non-linear, but no less Expressive for it.
- **Blue** (Internal Thinking):  I most associate with Informing and Withdrawing, making them fit into the Didactic Internal axis of RL. Blue wants to take a step back and see the truth from a distance, then explain that truth as a third party.
- **Purple** (Internal Feeling):  I most associate with Merging and Storytelling, making them fit into the Didactic External axis of RL. Purple wants to stoke passion in themself and others, expressing their emotions and feeling others deeply. This makes them the RL External opposite of Blue!
- **Indigo** (Internal Sensing):  I most associate with Merging and Withdrawing, making them fit into the Observing Quadrant of RL. Indigo wants to be embodied in the present moment with no discomfort, and ideally achieve that state for everyone around them.
- **Green** (Internal Intuiting):  I most associate with Performing and Informing, making them fit into the Storytelling Quadrant of RL. Green wants to see deeply into the past and future, and working with those long chains of logic often causes them to use Storytelling of both types.

It would seem my personal experience with Color model doesn't quite match Colors and RL Dialects! It's surprisingly close though! It seems I don't encounter too many people using the Interactive Dialects, since they're under-represented in my mapping.

Also interesting that the Socionics Internal/External Axis does not match to RL's Internal External Axis. I think that the Socionics axis actually maps more closely to the proposed Speaker/Listener axis! For example, Yellow is not just Commanding in my experience, but mostly Commanding Speaker. Yellow is often very bad at listening to Commands, and engages in Competitive Honing of skills, challenging other to prove they're more efficient and only giving once they've been proven wrong! Two Yellow people interacting looks like two Commanding Speakers trying to steal eachother's spotlight, while Interrogating eachother!

Similarly, Green people love listening to stories, while Red people love speaking those stories. Blue love listening to the facts more than speaking, Purple spend a good amount of time in their own emotional state and listening to that of others. But of course, as people grow in their skills these sorts of preferences wash out into a more varied holistic approach. Whether that's the influence of exposure to other Colors or to other RL, it's clear that both system are made of skills with no one pattern of growth.

Ultimately, I think this analysis underlines that the two models are made of mostly independent axis. I'd need far more evidence to make any strong claims about a correlation between a Color and a Dialect. Which is, to me, a wonderful thing because it means I can use the two together, synergistically! Now if only I had the working memory to hold all these axes!
