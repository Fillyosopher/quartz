# Identity as Settings
- The brain has many sub-organs, but only one of each
	- Example, try to narrative your thoughts.  Now try to narrate another thought at the same time.
- sub-organs are often configurable, although they can't always be changed quickly
	- Imagine your inner voice in a high pitch.  now imagine it in a lower pitch
- in plurality, a collection of settings becomes recognizably distinct from either the "default" or from other settings

# Thoughts as a data stream
- The brain is constantly generating system 2 thoughts
- Context switchs cause the brain to load a particular settings
- Once you have known settings, you can bucket thoughts by which setting they fit into

# Simultaneous processing
- Impressions are made by loading the easiest-to-swap settings to guess at a headmate's opinion
- Merges are formed when a blend of two settings files are used
- Parallel is when you time-share/context-switch between different settings files rapidly
