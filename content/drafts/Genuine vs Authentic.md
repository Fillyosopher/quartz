# The Outline
The Genuine Self is who you are when you exert very little willpower.
The Authentic Self is who you try to be, and usually requires willpower to force your Genuine Self into that shape.
The Social Self-space is the area of acceptible Authentic Self in a given culture.  It's a field, with some being more acceptable, and some limit of "no longer acceptible". Different people have different Space-following behavior.
The resulting presentation of self is a gestalt between all 3 influences, and constantly changes as each of the three change.

# Derived Concepts
- Genuine Emotions are what you actually feel. Coping mechanics are used to preserve the Authentic Self when those emotions don't fit it.  Bottling is common, while emotional reprocessing (turning anxiety into excitement, etc) is higher skill.
- The Genuine Self is pulled toward the Social Self-space and toward the Authentic Self during interactions.
- Plurality is the upkeep of multiple distinct Authentic Self.
- Authentic Self can be considered Persona, and can become architypal.
- Different conversational partners and settings subtly change the Social Self-space, both the boundaries and the optimal point.
- Masking is hiding the Genuine Self.
	- This is distinct from the natural pull of the Genuine Self toward the Authentic
	- Masking an emotion involves completely replacing it, faking a different one rather than building on or reinterpreting the Genuine one
	- Social Chameleon are pulled very strongly by the Social self-space
- Most Identity disorders relate to the Genuine Self.
- Sometimes, your Genuine Self is far from the Social Self-space, requiring a lot of effort.  This may be fixable or not.
	- The Axis of Oppression detail ways the Social Self-space uses unchangeable facets of a person.
- Trauma are habits which don't shift away in new context when they are no longer relevant.  These create a difficult to resolve gap between Genuine and Authentic self, where the Authentic wants to be well-fit to the situation but the Genuine does not update, requiring additional spoons.
