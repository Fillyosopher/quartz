Ideaspace is one of the foundational analogy of this site. Ideaspace treats ideas as literal territory to be navigated.  Intuitive Distance becomes physical distance, Notability becomes regonal landmarks.

# First Order words
These are the words that allow a novice to locate the ideaspace.  They are placed in the most obvious locations.  By analogy, on the tallest cliff point of the tallest cliff, visible for miles in all directions.

Professionals still need to know these First Order words, to assist with onboarding.  Since these words are so heavily used, they often deserve significant study and optimization.  By analogy, the cave just a minute away from the tallest cliff, a place you'd /actually/ come to the area to visit.

## First Order connections
These are connections used to navigate between specialist concept areas

# Second Order words
Professionals don't just need to locate the ideaspace, they need to navigate it.  Unlike with First Order words, there might not be any notable landmark associated with Second Order words. These words are often found by a sort of communal factor analysis, finding what concepts are used most often by those working in the space and naming them.  By analogy, these are the "local pub", where any local knows where you mean but foreigners would not.

## Inner Transition connections
These are well worn paths used to navigate from First Order words to Second Order words.  They often take the form of [[tags/Pattern]], describing a problem with the First Order word and how to derive the Second Order solution.  By analogy, these are the paths that locals travel to meet foreigners.

## Second Order connections
These are the connections between Second Order words.  In a newly explored area, there will be few of these, with most connections being Inner Transition.  But as a field becomes better known, the Second Order connections with become more numerous and well established.  By analogy, these are the hunting trails that slowly become the local roads.

## Outer Transition connections
These are the connections from Second Order words in one locale to another.  They represent non-intuitive connections between ideaspaces, things that only experts of one or the other field could find.  Outer Transitions are the most common way for new First Order words to be discovered.  By analogy, these are the secret or rarely used trails between settlements.

## Third Order words
Third Order words can also be thought of as a subsection of Second Order.  They are words which have no direct connection to First Order words.  These are often called Jargon, words which can only be explained in terms of concepts which are, themself, difficult to understand for an outside.  Attempting to explain them often results in [[h1/Sazen]]. By analogy, these are the hidden old shack that's out in the woods with no obvious path, but everyone knows its out there and talks about it sometimes.
