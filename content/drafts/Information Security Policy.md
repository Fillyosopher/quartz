# General Terms

- **No Action**: This information should not be acted upon. EG, if I said "I'm angry with X" in a No Action context, you should not tell X I'm angry nor try to resolve things yourself.
- **No Quote**: This text should not be copy-pasted as is, nor attributed to the author. Paraphrasing w/o attribution is fine.
- **No Signal Boost**: This information should not be relayed into a location which is 10x more visible w/o permission. EG no taking it from a 200 person Discord to a 20000 person Twitter account.
- **Locked Information**: This information has all three restrictions.  Don't Act on it, don't Quote it, and don't Signal Boost it.
- **Open Information**: This information can be Acted on, Quoted, and Signal Boosted.

# Outgoing Rules

1. Anything posted to this website is **Open Information**.
2. Anything posted online with a simple access gate is **No Signal Boost**.  This includes posts on sites like Discord as well as DMs.  Yes, you can Quote my DMs without asking (I feel this keeps me honest).
4. Any posts to my safe space channel (you'll know if you have access) are **No Quote & No Signal Boost**.
5. If ☢️ symbol shows up in a message, the message is **Locked Information**.

# Incoming Default Rules

These are the rules I use for things I read.  *If you want an exception to this policy, please ask.*

1. If it's posted online with no access gate, I assume it's **Open Information**.
2. If it's posted online with an access gate, I assume it's **No Signal Boost**. This includes Chat Rooms like Discord and voice calls with >2 people.
3. If it's posted to my DMs (Direct Messages) on any platform, I assume it's **Locked Information**.  I will ask before acting on it.  This includes voice calls with =2 people.
4. If ☢️ symbol shows up in a message in any location, I assume it's **Locked Information**.

## Exceptions

> [!warning]

- I will near universally comply with law enforcement agencies
  - Apologies, but I have too many dependents to jeopardize my status
- I will responsibly disclose suicide plans to a person's known support network
  - Responsibly means I wouldn't tell person who would likely exacerbate the situation, EG the police or an abusive mother
  - Disclose means I would privately inform trusted friends of the person, EG non-abusive partners or known supportive best friend
  - Plan means some sort of concrete actionable steps toward suicide.
  - I won't disclose suicidal ideation when no other concerning factors (such as a plan) are present.
  - Rationale: As someone who lived with Suicidal ideation for years, long after the danger of following through had passed, I think it is important to provide a safe space to talk about those thoughts without having them acted upon.  But that restraint ends the moment I believe it is more dangerous to keep the information private than otherwise.
