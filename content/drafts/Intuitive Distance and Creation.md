Intuitive Distance between Creator and Reader is always a careful thing to balance. On the one hand, trying to translate your concepts toward what the average reader can understand will make them easier to work with. But you can't be certain what the average reader actually knows, and trying to translate away from your own mental structures both takes effort and can obscure your real point in difficult to notice ways.

This problem is less severe when creating content for your future self, or for a friend. In these cases, your familiarity makes it easier to translate into forms you know they will understand.
