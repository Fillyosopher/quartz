While this model is primarily for "Relationships" in the sense of two people interacting over weeks, it can also be applied to individual interactions and to traits. EG, X is a Toxic Interaction if it harmed both parties, or Y is a Parasitic Trait if it benefits only one person.

## Model Overview

### 2 Variables of Relationship

- **Self Axis**: A relationship can be either good for you, or bad for you.
- **Other Axis**: A relationship can be either good for you partner, or bad for your partner

### 4 Types of Relationship

- **Symbiotic**: Relationships/interactions/traits that are Mutually Beneficial. They are good for both partners.
- **Parasitic**: Relationships/interactions/traits that have a One-sided Benefit for you. You gain from them, but your partner is harmed.
- **Charity**: Relationships/interactions/traits that have a One-sided Benefit for the partner. Your partner gains from them, but you are harmed.
- **Toxic**: Relationships/interactions/traits that are Mutually Detrimental. They harm both participants.

### 2 methods of altering a relationship

- **Altruistic**: Optimizing for the benefit of your partner. This involves changing parts of the interaction to make it better for your partners, such as by avoiding boundaries or by bringing utility.
  - Ideal Altruism benefits your partner at no cost to you.
  - Good Altruism benefits your partner more than it harms you, thus bringing the relationship closer to mutual benefit. It shifts the relationship toward Symbiotic and Charity.
  - Bad Altruism, AKA Martyrdom, harms you more than it benefits your partner. It shifts the relationship toward Charity and Toxic.
- **Egoistic**: Optimizing for your benefit. This involves changing parts of the interaction for that it's better for you, such as changing your form of payment.
  - Ideal Egoism benefits you at not cost to your partner.
  - Good Egoism benefits you more than it harms your partner, thus bringing the relationship closer to mutual benefit. It shifts the relationship toward Symbiotic and Parasitic.
  - Bad Egoism, AKA Narcissism, harms your partner more than it benefits you. It shifts the relationship toward Parasitic and Toxic.

### 4 methods of Relationship Optimization

- **Promote Good Altruism**: Look for cases where your Skills make it easy to help your partner, or where their Skill perfectly solve a your desires. Encourage asking eachother for help where the other person is strong or experienced, where a little bit of effort from them will save you a ton of time.
- **Avoid Bad Altruism**: Look for cases where you or your partner are using Skills that you're bad at "for eachother". Think about where you feel "forced" to do something for your partner, or vice versa. These should be reduced without any shame. Everyone is unique in their skills and their lack of skill, and relationships flourish on good trades, not bad ones.
- **Promote Good Egoism**: Be honest about what you really Want and Benefit from, and check what your partners Wants and Benefits from. Make sure you get those wants met, and that they do the same. It is important to be your own advocate, as you ultimately generally know what you Want best.
- **Avoid Bad Egoism**: Look for cases where you or your partner are asking for things you can't provide, or which mean little to them. This often looks like Bad Service with low [[drafts/A Review of Real Service#Annoyance Factor|Annoyance Factor]], where your partner forgets that you do it (because it doesn't matter to them) while you're putting effort in.
