It's surprisingly easy for people to stick to a limited ingroup and not realize the sheer variety of human experience out there. Imagine the scale of difference between "normal is the people I meet at church tea time" and "normal is the people I see on the bus".

In the first case, one's assumed normal is a limited set of humanity that mostly agree conform to a single philosophy, often share a [[drafts/A Review of Relating Languages|Relating Language]], often assume specific Color mindsets, etc. That's not to say it's an [Echo Chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)), just that it's a uniform slice of humanity!

In the second case, normal encompasses a far more vast slice of humanity. All sorts of people use the bus, from many walks of life, philosophies, ways of socializing, ways of relaxing. Buses are more on the "Cultural Meltingpot" side of things.

There are rider effects to one's conception of normal. People with a thin concept of normal are more prone to [Typical Mind Fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/typical-mind-fallacy), tending to assume that others are broken versions of themself rather than completely functional humans in a different mode. Meanwhile, people with a wide concept of normal are less likely to be surprised by people from other cultures, with other values, with other ways of speaking or thinking, etc.
