## Outline
- I've been troubled by the External-Internal Axis
	- The failure mode of "Interrogation" isn't "too much selfishness"
	- Calling it "Internal Dialect" (too much selfishness) doesn't help someone fix it
- Alternate model, Creating Mismatched Expectations
	- You're in Directing Mode
	- You ask a question, inadvertently signally Questioning
	- Your conversational partner answers in a Questioning mode
	- You cut them off (because Directing), not realizing you broke their expectations of the conversation
- Aside: Misunderstanding
	- Does not require trickery or bad faith
	- A misunderstanding occurs when the listener gets a different meaning than the speaker intended after decoding the message
- Transaction Analysis: Games
	- Quick Summary of Transactional Analysis
- Pulling it together
	- Mismatched Expectations reads like a Game
	- Many culture/locations expect Egalitarian speech (same mode in speaker and listener)
	- The "mode switch" created in the listener mimics the Switch
	- This creates competing goals in the listener: to "fix" the mode, switch mental tracks, or be on the back foot
	- Note: this can happen even when the speaker was clear about the style they wanted, but was misunderstood
- How does this work?
	- The Receptive -> Expressive Switch: Speaker does Unexpected and repeated "interruptions"
	- The Expressive -> Receptive Switch: Listener responses appear Unresponsive, slow, or uninterested
	- The Interactive -> Didactic Switch: Speaker takes an Unfairly Long turns, or seems Unresponsive to attempts to take the conversation back
	- The Didactic -> Interactive Switch: Listener does Unexpected and repeated "interruptions"
- Examples?
	- Door salesperson: Asks you a few questions without stating who they are, starts a friendly dialog, then cuts you off to give a long pre-prepared speech on roof repair.  This is a Receptive -> Expressive and Interactive -> Didactic switch
- Adding onto the model
	- Internal Dialects reframed as "Speaker Mistakes"
	- External Dialects reframed as "Listener Mistakes"
	- Questioning: Speaker expects responses, Listener expects time to answer.
		- Interrogation: Speaker breaks contract by not giving time to answer (Expressive switch) or Never asking the question (Didactic switch)
		- Service: Listener breaks contract by cutting off the question (Expressive switch) or by not giving complete responses (Didactic Switch)
	- Observing: Speaker expects responses, Listener expects time to answer.
		- Withdrawing: 
		- Merging: 
	- Storytelling: Speaker expects responses, Listener expects time to answer.
		- Informing: Speaker breaks contract by getting annoyed at minor interruptions (Receptive switch) or  (Interactive switch)
		- Performing: 
	- Directing: Speaker expects responses, Listener expects time to answer.
		- Commanding: 
		- Suggesting: 
- Where this doesn't apply
	- Hierarchical conversation, where the Listener is /not/ expected to match the speaker's mode
		- You don't interrupt at a Speech after all, you're supposed to Observe while they Storytell
