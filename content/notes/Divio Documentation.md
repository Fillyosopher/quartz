Divio Documentation System

# Patlet
The Divio Documentation system splits documentation along two axis into 4 possible types.  This allows the writer to focus on a particular audience, and results in superior documentation.

The two axis are: 
- Studying vs Working
- Theoretical vs Practical

Leading to four types of documentation:
- Tutorials are learning oriented, for Practical Study
- Explanations are understanding oriented, for Theoretical Study
- How-To Guides are problem oriented, for Practical Work
- Reference Documents are information oriented, for Theoretical Work
