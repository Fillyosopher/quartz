# Outline

## General Terms
- **Partner**: General term for one who you have a relationship with.
- **Metamour**: The partner of your partner (who is not your direct partner).

## Emotions
- **New Relationship Energy (NRE)**: the rush of emotions that come from a brand new relationship, which last during the period of discovery, but tend to trail off over time.
- **Established Relationship Energy (ERE)**: the comfortable and stable feelings that come from a long-running relationship, which tend to build over time.  Often the deciding factor for "Primary" relationship status.
- **Friends with benefits**: Relationships that involve both Sexual and Emotional energies, but not Romantic (or perhaps not "long term").  Often used for relationship that lack NRE and ERE
- **Polysaturated**: Feeling like you have *enough* partners or that your relationship needs are met

## Relationship Structure Stereotypes
- **Closed Polycule**: A group of 3 or more adults who have no relationships outside of the group
- **Open Polycule**: A group of 3 or more adults who are connected by relationships and who are free to pursue additional relationships

## Information Sharing Expectations
- **Lap-Sitting Polyamory**: A form of Polyamory in which metamours distincts are very small.  "Your partner is someone I can touch too."
- **Kitchen Table Polyamory**: A form of Polyamory where two partners have other relationships in full view of eachother. When partners expect to interact with metamours in non-formal settings
- **Garden Party Polyamory**: a middleground between kitchen table and parallel polyamory.  When partners expect to interact with metamours in only formal settings.
- **Parallel Polyamory**: A form of Polyamory where two partners have other relationships independantly.  When partners expect not to interact with metamours at all.
- **Don't Ask, Don't Tell**: Consensual Polyamory in which two partners are allowed to have other relationships so long as they don't talk about them.  For when partners expect to /not even know if metamours exist/.

## Individal Relationship Stereotypes
- **Fluid Bonding**: Not using barriers for sexual activities (usually meaning penetrative sex) in the relationship.  While this level of intimacy is important in monogamy too, it takes on a different importance for Poly due to the danger of spreading STDs through polycule.
- **Nesting Partner**: Partner(s) with whom you live.  Co-living involves a large amount of communication and coordination which can often give relationships a new dimension and meaning to a person.

## Relationship Heirarchy Terms
Some Polyamorous people use Heirarchical terms to sort their relationships.  Not to be confused with "Heirarchical Relationships", which are more the realm of BDSM.
- **Primary Partner**: The "most important" relationship a polyamorous person has, often denotes the presence of "Established Relationship Energy".  Sometimes called Anchor Partner.
- **Secondary Partner**: Non-primary partners who are still close.
- **Tertiary Partner**: no universal definition, rarely used.  When used, generally used FWB or similar.  That said, ask the person for clarificaiton if needed.
- **Non-Hierarchical Relationships**: Having a egalitarian/equal stance to all of one's relationships, often as a philosophical stance
- **Relationship Anarchy**: Not defining/experiencing heirarchy of relationships, or not putting terms on relationships.
- **Chosen Family**: Having familial roles/relationships to non-blood.  Also called "Poly Family"
- **Solo Polyamory**: an individual who is poly "by themself".  Oftens means having no Nesting Partners or having no Primary Partners.

## Situational Terms
- **Telemour**: partner of one's Metamour.  Generally unnecessary, but can be useful when explaining the far reachs of one's polycule.
- **Veto**: In the context of poly, the right for one's partner to "veto" a new relationship.  Generally reserved for Primary partners.
- **Relationship Orientation**: The idea that Monoamory:Polyamory::Straight:Gay.  That Polyamory is an orientation that a person can be more or less oriented toward.
