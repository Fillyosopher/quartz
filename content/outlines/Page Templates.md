Templates are premade guidelines for how to format content on this site. As pages are revisited and refined, they are moved to be more and more compliant with the site templates.

> [!warning] Some Links Not Available On Website
>
> Many links on this page go to Templates. We do not publish Templates to the web, so these links will fail if you're viewing the website. This is done to avoid polluting the Taxonomy pages. EG, the "Outline" template has tag Outline, but shouldn't show up on the  Outline page
