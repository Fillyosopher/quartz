# Patlet

A Definition is a simple explanation of a word or phrase that doesn't use recursive explanation. Definitions are most useful when a word lacks an obvious "Problem" (and thus can't use a [[patterns/Pattern Page|Pattern Page]]) while also not having clear axis (and thus can't use a [[Model Page]]).

# Problem

A rare word or phrase falls outside of Simple English.  It's an important Lens by which to analyze the world... but it's standalone, meaning it's hard to explain the word via comparisons to other concepts.  And it doesn't solve a particular problem.  Thus, you need a way to explain the concept that doesn't rely on other knowledge nor on the narrative of a problem statement.

# Solution
Use a Dictionary format to explain the word with no assumption of previous knowledge.  Then link out to other concepts.  Despite them being more distant from each other than you'd see in a coherent Model, those links are still important to show how the word or phrase connects to other ideas.

This is the least structured page type, and should generally be avoided.  If a concept can be folded into a larger model or pattern, it should be.  Regular review of Definition pages can help identify floating ideas that belong inside other compilation pages.
