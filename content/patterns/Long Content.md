# Patlet
A Creator is producing Content, but finds what they produce is soon irrelevant. They rarely revisit prior work to enhance it.  Users, similarly, rarely revisit the majority of their consumed Content because it loses relevance quickly. In order to produce content that remains relevant, a shift in topic and mindset around content creation is needed, as well as practice with the skill of Refinement.

# Problem
Content has a half-life of [[drafts/Relevance]] so short that it is forgotten by both Creator and reader within weeks.

# Story
For decades, we've been taking constant notes and attempting to distill useful thought patterns to share with friends.  However, our attempts to share that content consistently fail, in that the completed product

# Context
- Creator wants to create content which remains useful over a long period of time
- Readers want content which sticks with them and can be revisited

# Forces
- The Creator exists in a culture of monetizable Short Content and draws heavily from that style.
- The Creator finds their content quickly degrade in usefulness
- The Creator is only skilled at Creating, but not Refining

# Solution
Intentionally Create and Refine Long Content

## Long Content is Revisited
To create Long Content, it's not enough to center your content on ideas.  You must also revisit that content and, ideally, make it better when you do.  If you don't find yourself revisiting a page (even if only to link it to someone else), then it must have lost [[drafts/Relevance]].

How can you make sure a page is revisited?  To start, Highlight Ideas. Short Content is often framed around a particular event or product.  But events fade into the distances, and it become unclear if the content has anything worth saying in the new present.  Some content creators try to balance this, using a particular event or product to frame discussion of the larger issue, but because the event or product take up [[Search Length]], the content still suffers from reduced searchability over time.

## Long Content is Refined
It is incredibly rare for Content to be complete and definitive for more than a few years, even when designed to be so.  Most Content is neither complete nor definitive, ever.  Long Content is no different.

Therefore, treat every piece of content as a draft.  When it is revisited, either by the Creator or the Reader, it will be checked for continued relevance and correctness.  Use feedback to improve and expand the content, updating its relevance and often raising it beyond its previous relevance.

# Resulting Context
- Writer creates pages that will remain relevant, even if they are not "finished" nor "definitive"
- Writer refines their pages over time, resulting in increasing relevance over time rather than decreasing
