# Patlet
When attempting to learn a new area of knowledge, it can be difficult to know how to proceed.  Glossary fail to highlight important words, Blog posts represent random subsections of the ideaspace.  The solution is a heirarchical breakdown of major ideas and their [[h1/Sazen]].

# Problem
New areas of knowledge are like [[drafts/Ideaspace and Words|Unexplored Land]]. At start, we gravitate toward their most notable features.  But over time, we form knowledge of the truely important ideas, which may not be notable on first examination.  However, this knowledge is difficult to communicate without manually leading someone through all the concepts.  A newcomer to the field is stuck picking it up as they go along.

# Solution
Create a page which optimizes for shallow Explanations (ala [[patterns/Divio Documentation]]) and Heirarchical Context. Call out the natural paths into and out of the topic.  Give the most important subsections of the topic.  Then present the local knowledge, alongsize definitions that, if not full explanations for a newcomer, at least allow them to direct themselves to the knowledge they want, while also allowing locals easy access to what they need.

See [[patterns/Outline Page]] for this site's implimentation of Heirarchical Outlines.
