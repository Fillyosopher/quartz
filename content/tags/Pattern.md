A Pattern is a collection of ideas which solve a problem in a reusesable way.  They represent a fusion of the [[notes/Divio Documentation]] Explanation and How-to Guide.

Minimally, they're made of a [[h1/Sazen]], a problem statement, and a solution.

Ideally, they are made of
- A [[h1/Sazen]]
- A [[h1/Patlet]], a single paragraph summary
- A Problem statement
- A Story, example of problem state (Green)
- A Context, situational factors in which the problem occurs
- A Forces summary, which details the incentive systems at play
- A Solution, which details actions to take to resolve the problem
- A Resulting Context, which details the state after the solution actions are taken
- Known Instances, a list of examples where this Pattern was used
