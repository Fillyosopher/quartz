# Patlet
A Pattern is a collection of ideas which solve a problem in a reusesable way.  They represent a specific style of [[patterns/Divio Documentation]] How-to Guide. See [[templates/Pattern]] for this site's template.  This page, itself, is written as a Pattern.

# Problem
A Problem occurs frequently, in a variety of context, with a common solution.  Time is wasted recreating the solution from scratch each time.  It's occassionally unclear if a given instance is similar enough for a previous solution to still apply.

# Story

# Context

# Forces

# Solution
Document the problem and solution into a Pattern, working backward from Instance up to Patlet.  

Minimally, the Pattern documentation should include a name, a problem statement, and a solution.

Ideally, the Pattern documentation should include
- A name
- A [[h1/Patlet]], a single paragraph summary
- A Problem statement
- A Story, example of problem state (Green)
- A Context, situational factors in which the problem occurs
- A Forces summary, which details the incentive systems at play
- A Solution, which details actions to take to resolve the problem
- A Resulting Context, which details the state after the solution actions are taken
- Known Instances, a list of examples where this Pattern was used

# Resulting Context

# Instances
- [Inner Source Patterns](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/) - where the writing style came from.  Also see: [Their Contributor Handbook](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/meta/contributor-handbook.md)
- [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) - the original location that got me thinking in patterns
