The master knows exactly how to do the task. The master is taking responsibility for verifying the servant knows exactly what to do. The servant asks few questions due to the few gaps in the instructions.</li><li>Basic: assume previous or relevant related knowledge, and can make decisions when instructions have gaps. The master may know exactly how to do the task, just a general idea. The master has a specific result in mind. The servant asks questions only where the intended result is unclear or there is a significant gap in the instructions.</li><li>Minimal: assumes the servant is familiar with all aspects of service. The servant may be making complex decisions regarding methods. The master may have little understanding of how the service is performed, and only a general idea of the desired outcome. The servant asks few questions regarding the details, instead clarifying the intended goal. If the master requests things without understanding repercussions, it is the servant&rsquo;s responsibility to inform the master. The servant is responsible for determining the outcome is desirable.</li></ul><a href=#extra-definitions><h3 id=extra-definitions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Extra Definitions</h3></a><p>Without Prompting:</p><ul><li>Means that once an order is given, it is carried out without reminders /from the master/</li><li>External reminders are most likely allowed and encouraged</li><li>A reminder from the master should never be relied upon</li><li>for Active and Proactive servants, with Standing Orders or Anticipatory Service
Reasonable Manner:</li><li>Occasionally, due to different upbringings or context, a master and servant may be misaligned in their understandings</li><li>These should be corrected with clearer communication on the first instance, and treated as any other mistake on the second instance.</li></ul><a href=#annoyance><h2 id=annoyance><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Annoyance</h2></a><p>This is not a chapter of a book, but is a core point spread across it that needs to be better stated.</p><p>Annoyance: a core emotion by which Masters discovers an opportunity for service.</p><p>Annoyance is how you notice spots in your Routine where a servant could make things run easier.
A Task is only worth training on if, when the servant performs that task, it reduces your annoyance.
Annoyance is the emotion you will feel when a task was not complete. It lets you know when to provide further instruction or disciple. Tasks which do not reduce Annoyance will be easily forgotten by both Master and servant.
Reduction in Annoyance is how you evaluate the worth of a Servant. It is how you locate avenues of praise.
&ldquo;Service&rdquo; which annoys you is not Service at all. Never accept &ldquo;Service&rdquo; which adds new Annoyance under any circumstance. It is dishonest to your servant and a failure of your role.
Certain emotional communication, eg nagging or bitterness, are highly likely to evoke annoyance. God servants should endeavor to remove these from their language, and good master should train against that behavior.</p><a href=#secondary-notes><h1 id=secondary-notes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Secondary Notes</h1></a><a href=#joshuas-rules-of-service><h2 id=joshuas-rules-of-service><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Joshua&rsquo;s Rules of Service</h2></a><ul><li>First Rule of Service: If the master doesn&rsquo;t want it, it isn&rsquo;t service.<ul><li>This doesn&rsquo;t preclude it being &ldquo;good&rdquo; in some sense, but don&rsquo;t mistake that for service.</li><li>mis-aligned service can pressure an M-type into accepting service they don&rsquo;t want</li><li>M-types accepting service they don&rsquo;t want has many bad consequences<ul><li>It&rsquo;s dishonest to their s-type</li><li>It assumes the s-type can&rsquo;t handle correction</li><li>It assumes the s-type isn&rsquo;t worth training</li><li>It deprives the s-type of any chance to improve</li><li>It causes the s-type to waste time, both immediately and in the future</li><li>It means the M-type isn&rsquo;t actually in charge. Either the s-types emotions, or the M-types fears are in charge.</li></ul></li><li>There are many ways to correct mis-aligned service<ul><li>Correct M-type fears: s-types do not want low expectations</li><li>Correct s-type emotions: provide support if needed</li><li>Correct s-type&rsquo;s knowledge: explain and redirect their service desires</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Second Rule of Service: Contempt has no place in service.<ul><li>Contempt, in either direction, weakens the relationship</li><li>M-type contempt for an s-type: shows a lack of security in their role. A true M-type is confident in their ability to direct.</li><li>A good servant is something to be respect as a valuable resource and skilled worker doing what they enjoy.</li><li>s-type contempt for an M-type: shows a lack of security in their role. A true s-type is confident their M-type can direct.</li><li>Beware shadenfreud when your M-type fails or shows incompitance.</li></ul></li><li>Third Rule of Service: a bad attitude is corrosive to both servant and relationship<ul><li>Many people in service positions are forced there, explaining any bad attitude. But a consensual servant does not have this excuse.</li><li>Bitterness and sulking are a stress release, which indicates perhaps the s-type does not desire to do service.</li><li>Over time, the association between service and bitterness can taint the whole.</li><li>If possible, replace bitterness with a striving for excellence in every task.</li></ul></li><li>Fourth Rule of Service: a good servant wants their master to be right.<ul><li>There is a common dilemma in a s-type&rsquo;s life: wanting to be Right versus wanting to be Obediant.</li><li>Disagreements between master and servant will happen.</li><li>When they do, a good servant does the following<ul><li>make a respectful attempt to correct</li><li>follow the request given, whether it has changed or not, to the best of your ability</li><li>decide once and for all if the master is incompetent to an extreme length (putting others in danger).</li><li>If they are not, relax and let go. Recenter. You want them to be right.

These are the things you can reinforce easily.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t fall for tasks which look good in a scene but might slip unnoticed by you. It is bad to give your servant a task that you cannot even remember to train them on.</li><li>Good Idea: Servant picks out two meals, the master can eat either or from both, the servant can finish whatever isn&rsquo;t chosen.</li><li>Work on one rule at a time, find out if it will stay, then move on.</li><li>(From later in the book) Do not pick tasks for which no amount of service can remove your annoyance.</li></ul><a href=#optimizing-for-priorities><h3 id=optimizing-for-priorities><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Optimizing for Priorities</h3></a><ul><li>Sometimes, tasks will be done differently than expected</li><li>Usually, this is a difference in Priority<ul><li>EG &ldquo;Why do you take this less efficient path?&rdquo; &ldquo;It brings me joy&rdquo;</li><li>Literally just Color Model</li></ul></li><li>Many issues of Priority will be so minor as to be ignorable</li><li>Master-side: if they continue to do it their way, will it cease to be service</li><li>Servant-side: No one is going to die if I do things Master&rsquo;s way</li><li>It is important, early in a relationship, that the Master always take a Blue tone, so as not to through Purple signals give the wrong impression.

These are places your servant might be able to assist you.</li><li>Visualize how your servant would fit into the situation. Do they have the requisite skill and attitude? Remember that a good servant may benefit from seeing your process (especially Proactive types)</li><li>Slowly integrate them into the process. It&rsquo;s okay for them to start by doing little. Point out your annoyances, show them how to assist when those occur. If, after thorough consideration, they can&rsquo;t help? Drop the idea.</li><li>Do not feel pressure to accomidate a servant&rsquo;s desire to change the process to be easier for them. Be honest, with yourself and your servant, in evaluating any suggestions.</li><li>Do not accept inconveniences: remember that annoyance indicates a desire for service. Service itself should never evoke annoyance.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Assisting when Master can&rsquo;t define the final state (chapter name For Servants: Minimally Invasive Organizing)</p><ul><li>Start by observing the current workflow.

But for 24/7 servants, forgetting to pick up a child or buy food can have real world and significant consequences beyond master&rsquo;s displeasure.</li><li>No one is perfect. Account for true accidents. Set an acceptible margin for each task.</li><li>In general, long-term servants do not respond well to &ldquo;punishment&rdquo;. They take pride and stake some of their identity on their tasks. The only time punishment makes sense is an instantaneous response to correct habitual behavior, as explicit operant conditioning.
The recommendations:<ul><li>Bring the servant&rsquo;s attention to the situation</li><li>verify that the problem is understood</li><li>Determine why the problem occurred</li><li>Develop a plan for preventing this problem in the future</li><li>If necessary, re-evaluate the servant&rsquo;s capabilities</li></ul></li><li>When failures persist, the best approach is to durastically reduce expectations of competance, slowly build back up from there. Make the task painfully simple, add complexity only one the simple has been completely mastered<ul><li>For emotionally sensative servant, can help develop confidence</li><li>For less emotionally sensitive, mild humiliation can be incorporated.
