It may not comply with the site Templates. See [[Content Lifecycle]] for more information on Drafts.\n\n# The Outline\nThe Genuine Self is who you are when you exert very little willpower.\nThe Authentic Self is who you try to be, and usually requires willpower to force your Genuine Self into that shape.\nThe Social Self-space is the area of acceptible Authentic Self in a given culture.  It's a field, with some being more acceptable, and some limit of \"no longer acceptible\". Different people have different Space-following behavior.\nThe resulting presentation of self is a gestalt between all 3 influences, and constantly changes as each of the three change.\n\n# Derived Concepts\n- Genuine Emotions are what you actually feel. Coping mechanics are used to preserve the Authentic Self when those emotions don't fit it.  Bottling is common, while emotional reprocessing (turning anxiety into excitement, etc) is higher skill.\n- The Genuine Self is pulled toward the Social Self-space and toward the Authentic Self during interactions.\n- Plurality is the upkeep of multiple distinct Authentic Self.\n- Authentic Self can be considered Persona, and can become architypal.\n- Different conversational partners and settings subtly change the Social Self-space, both the boundaries and the optimal point.\n- Masking is hiding the Genuine Self.\n\t- This is distinct from the natural pull of the Genuine Self toward the Authentic\n\t- Masking an emotion involves completely replacing it, faking a different one rather than building on or reinterpreting the Genuine one\n\t- Social Chameleon are pulled very strongly by the Social self-space\n- Most Identity disorders relate to the Genuine Self.\n- Sometimes, your Genuine Self is far from the Social Self-space, requiring a lot of effort.  This may be fixable or not.\n\t- The Axis of Oppression detail ways the Social Self-space uses unchangeable facets of a person.\n- Trauma are habits which don't shift away in new context when they are no longer relevant.  These create a difficult to resolve gap between Genuine and Authentic self, where the Authentic wants to be well-fit to the situation but the Genuine does not update, requiring additional spoons.\n\n# Skill States\n| State | Genuine | Authentic | Space-following |\n| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |\n| Healthy | Balanced | Balanced | Balanced |\n| Identity Disorders | Weak | Balanced | Balanced |\n| Social Anxiety | Balanced | Weak | Balanced |\n| \"Weird\" | Balanced | Balanced | Weak |\n|  | Strong | Balanced | Balanced |\n| Feeling constrained by your role | Balanced | Strong | Balanced |\n| Involuntary Social Chameleon | Balanced | Balanced | Strong |\n\n\n\n#draft","lastmodified":"2023-04-26T17:39:23.48979022Z","tags":["Draft"]},"/drafts/Ideaspace-and-Words":{"title":"Ideaspace and Words","content":"\u003e [!info] Draft \n\u003eThis is a Draft. It may not comply with the site Templates. See [[Content Lifecycle]] for more information on Drafts.\n\nIdeaspace is one of the foundational analogy of this site. Ideaspace treats ideas as literal territory to be navigated.  Intuitive Distance becomes physical distance, Notability becomes regonal landmarks.\n\n# First Order words\nThese are the words that allow a novice to locate the ideaspace.  They are placed in the most obvious locations.  By analogy, on the tallest cliff point of the tallest cliff, visible for miles in all directions.\n\nProfessionals still need to know these First Order words, to assist with onboarding.  Since these words are so heavily used, they often deserve significant study and optimization.  By analogy, the cave just a minute away from the tallest cliff, a place you'd /actually/ come to the area to visit.\n\n## First Order connections\nThese are connections used to navigate between specialist concept areas\n\n# Second Order words\nProfessionals don't just need to locate the ideaspace, they need to navigate it.  Unlike with First Order words, there might not be any notable landmark associated with Second Order words. These words are often found by a sort of communal factor analysis, finding what concepts are used most often by those working in the space and naming them.  By analogy, these are the \"local pub\", where any local knows where you mean but foreigners would not.\n\n## Inner Transition connections\nThese are well worn paths used to navigate from First Order words to Second Order words.  They often take the form of [[tags/Pattern]], describing a problem with the First Order word and how to derive the Second Order solution.  By analogy, these are the paths that locals travel to meet foreigners.\n\n## Second Order connections\nThese are the connections between Second Order words.  In a newly explored area, there will be few of these, with most connections being Inner Transition.  But as a field becomes better known, the Second Order connections with become more numerous and well established.  By analogy, these are the hunting trails that slowly become the local roads.\n\n## Outer Transition connections\nThese are the connections from Second Order words in one locale to another.  They represent non-intuitive connections between ideaspaces, things that only experts of one or the other field could find.  Outer Transitions are the most common way for new First Order words to be discovered.  By analogy, these are the secret or rarely used trails between settlements.\n\n## Third Order words\nThird Order words can also be thought of as a subsection of Second Order.  They are words which have no direct connection to First Order words.  These are often called Jargon, words which can only be explained in terms of concepts which are, themself, difficult to understand for an outside.  Attempting to explain them often results in [[h1/Sazen]]. By analogy, these are the hidden old shack that's out in the woods with no obvious path, but everyone knows its out there and talks about it sometimes.\n\n#draft","lastmodified":"2023-04-26T17:39:23.48979022Z","tags":["Draft"]},"/drafts/Information-Security-Policy":{"title":"Information Security Policy","content":"\u003e [!info] Draft \n\u003eThis is a Draft.

You must also revisit that content and, ideally, make it better when you do.  If you don't find yourself revisiting a page (even if only to link it to someone else), then it must have lost [[drafts/Relevance]].\n\nHow can you make sure a page is revisited?  To start, Highlight Ideas. Short Content is often framed around a particular event or product.  But events fade into the distances, and it become unclear if the content has anything worth saying in the new present.  Some content creators try to balance this, using a particular event or product to frame discussion of the larger issue, but because the event or product take up [[Search Length]], the content still suffers from reduced searchability over time.\n\n## Long Content is Refined\nIt is incredibly rare for Content to be complete and definitive for more than a few years, even when designed to be so.  Most Content is neither complete nor definitive, ever.  Long Content is no different.\n\nTherefore, treat every piece of content as a draft.  When it is revisited, either by the Creator or the Reader, it will be checked for continued relevance and correctness.  Use feedback to improve and expand the content, updating its relevance and often raising it beyond its previous relevance.\n\n# Resulting Context\n- Writer creates pages that will remain relevant, even if they are not \"finished\" nor \"definitive\"\n- Writer refines their pages over time, resulting in increasing relevance over time rather than decreasing\n\n# Instances\n- Gwern's [Long Content](https://gwern.net/about#long-content)  - where I first encountered the concept\n- This Site\n\n#Pattern #Quality-2","lastmodified":"2023-04-26T17:39:23.48979022Z","tags":["Pattern"]},"/site-Ideas":{"title":"site Ideas","content":"\n- Add a markdown linter\n- Add a prose linter\n- Add a documentation linter\n- Change TOC to include h1 through h3","lastmodified":"2023-04-26T17:39:23.48979022Z","tags":[]},"/tag-Ideas":{"title":"tag Ideas","content":"\n- make one for each of the [[patterns/Divio Documentation]] options\n\t- Make sure they're [Long Content](https://gwern.net/about#long-content) worthy\n- Do we want one for How-To besides Pattern?

Predictions are useful for grounding your personal confidence as well as establishing your expertise publicly.  However, it's too easy for the human brain to move goalposts after the fact, even without intended to.  Therefore, Predictions should be made in terms of decibels or percentages, and posted publicly ahead of time to ensure they function as actual grounding and calibration. See [[templates/Prediction]] for this site's template.\n\n# Problem\nIt's difficult to know how confident you should be regarding, well, anything.  Humans use a lot of stand-ins for actual predictive power, things like prestige, education, charisma.  Even internally, it's easy to undersell or oversell your predictive capabilities (EG imposture syndrome, mania).
