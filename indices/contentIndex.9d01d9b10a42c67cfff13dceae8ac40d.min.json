The master knows exactly how to do the task. The master is taking responsibility for verifying the servant knows exactly what to do. The servant asks few questions due to the few gaps in the instructions.\n- Basic: assume previous or relevant related knowledge, and can make decisions when instructions have gaps. The master may know exactly how to do the task, just a general idea. The master has a specific result in mind. The servant asks questions only where the intended result is unclear or there is a significant gap in the instructions.\n- Minimal: assumes the servant is familiar with all aspects of service. The servant may be making complex decisions regarding methods. The master may have little understanding of how the service is performed, and only a general idea of the desired outcome. The servant asks few questions regarding the details, instead clarifying the intended goal. If the master requests things without understanding repercussions, it is the servant's responsibility to inform the master. The servant is responsible for determining the outcome is desirable.\n\n### Extra Definitions\n\nWithout Prompting:\n\n- Means that once an order is given, it is carried out without reminders /from the master/\n- External reminders are most likely allowed and encouraged\n- A reminder from the master should never be relied upon\n- for Active and Proactive servants, with Standing Orders or Anticipatory Service\nReasonable Manner:\n- Occasionally, due to different upbringings or context, a master and servant may be misaligned in their understandings\n- These should be corrected with clearer communication on the first instance, and treated as any other mistake on the second instance.\n\n## Annoyance\n\nThis is not a chapter of a book, but is a core point spread across it that needs to be better stated.\n\nAnnoyance: a core emotion by which Masters discovers an opportunity for service.\n\nAnnoyance is how you notice spots in your Routine where a servant could make things run easier.\nA Task is only worth training on if, when the servant performs that task, it reduces your annoyance.\nAnnoyance is the emotion you will feel when a task was not complete. It lets you know when to provide further instruction or disciple. Tasks which do not reduce Annoyance will be easily forgotten by both Master and servant.\nReduction in Annoyance is how you evaluate the worth of a Servant. It is how you locate avenues of praise.\n\"Service\" which annoys you is not Service at all. Never accept \"Service\" which adds new Annoyance under any circumstance. It is dishonest to your servant and a failure of your role.\nCertain emotional communication, eg nagging or bitterness, are highly likely to evoke annoyance. God servants should endeavor to remove these from their language, and good master should train against that behavior.\n\n# Secondary Notes\n\n## Joshua's Rules of Service\n\n- First Rule of Service: If the master doesn't want it, it isn't service.\n  - This doesn't preclude it being \"good\" in some sense, but don't mistake that for service.\n  - mis-aligned service can pressure an M-type into accepting service they don't want\n  - M-types accepting service they don't want has many bad consequences\n    - It's dishonest to their s-type\n    - It assumes the s-type can't handle correction\n    - It assumes the s-type isn't worth training\n    - It deprives the s-type of any chance to improve\n    - It causes the s-type to waste time, both immediately and in the future\n    - It means the M-type isn't actually in charge. Either the s-types emotions, or the M-types fears are in charge.\n  - There are many ways to correct mis-aligned service\n    - Correct M-type fears: s-types do not want low expectations\n    - Correct s-type emotions: provide support if needed\n    - Correct s-type's knowledge: explain and redirect their service desires\n- Second Rule of Service: Contempt has no place in service.\n  - Contempt, in either direction, weakens the relationship\n  - M-type contempt for an s-type: shows a lack of security in their role. A true M-type is confident in their ability to direct.\n  - A good servant is something to be respect as a valuable resource and skilled worker doing what they enjoy.\n  - s-type contempt for an M-type: shows a lack of security in their role. A true s-type is confident their M-type can direct.\n  - Beware shadenfreud when your M-type fails or shows incompitance.\n- Third Rule of Service: a bad attitude is corrosive to both servant and relationship\n  - Many people in service positions are forced there, explaining any bad attitude. But a consensual servant does not have this excuse.\n  - Bitterness and sulking are a stress release, which indicates perhaps the s-type does not desire to do service.\n  - Over time, the association between service and bitterness can taint the whole.\n  - If possible, replace bitterness with a striving for excellence in every task.\n- Fourth Rule of Service: a good servant wants their master to be right.\n  - There is a common dilemma in a s-type's life: wanting to be Right versus wanting to be Obediant.\n  - Disagreements between master and servant will happen.\n  - When they do, a good servant does the following\n    - make a respectful attempt to correct\n    - follow the request given, whether it has changed or not, to the best of your ability\n    - decide once and for all if the master is incompetent to an extreme length (putting others in danger).\n    - If they are not, relax and let go. Recenter. You want them to be right. Try to make it so.\n\n## Annoyance Factor\n\n- It is the M-type's responsibility to checkup, assess, and enforce.\n- Mistake is exepecially common when transitioning from part-time/scene-oriented service to full-time/live-in dynamic.\n- Scenes are high-intensity D/s, Live-in are by necessaity not that.\n- For M-types: pick tasks which, when they aren't done, give you noticable annoyance. These are the things you can reinforce easily.\n- Don't fall for tasks which look good in a scene but might slip unnoticed by you. It is bad to give your servant a task that you cannot even remember to train them on.\n- Good Idea: Servant picks out two meals, the master can eat either or from both, the servant can finish whatever isn't chosen.\n- Work on one rule at a time, find out if it will stay, then move on.\n- (From later in the book) Do not pick tasks for which no amount of service can remove your annoyance.\n\n### Optimizing for Priorities\n\n- Sometimes, tasks will be done differently than expected\n- Usually, this is a difference in Priority\n  - EG \"Why do you take this less efficient path?\" \"It brings me joy\"\n  - Literally just Color Model\n- Many issues of Priority will be so minor as to be ignorable\n- Master-side: if they continue to do it their way, will it cease to be service\n- Servant-side: No one is going to die if I do things Master's way\n- It is important, early in a relationship, that the Master always take a Blue tone, so as not to through Purple signals give the wrong impression. Only later, once communication and trust is built, can Purple be shown without disrupting requests.\n\n### For Masters: Integrating the Servant Into the Routine\n\n- It is insecure to want complete self-sufficiency or to avoid \"becoming dependant on someone\"\n- \"I am better at X, why should I allow Y to do it?\"\n  - You are the Master. You choose the tasks. If no quality of service would fix your Annoyance, then it is not an appropriate task.\n  - Even masters of a craft can find monotonous portions of work which they can offload\n- On generating tasks for your servant\n  - Do your normal routine and write down each time you become annoyed. These are places your servant might be able to assist you.\n  - Visualize how your servant would fit into the situation. Do they have the requisite skill and attitude? Remember that a good servant may benefit from seeing your process (especially Proactive types)\n  - Slowly integrate them into the process. It's okay for them to start by doing little. Point out your annoyances, show them how to assist when those occur. If, after thorough consideration, they can't help? Drop the idea.\n  - Do not feel pressure to accomidate a servant's desire to change the process to be easier for them. Be honest, with yourself and your servant, in evaluating any suggestions.\n  - Do not accept inconveniences: remember that annoyance indicates a desire for service. Service itself should never evoke annoyance.\n\nAssisting when Master can't define the final state (chapter name For Servants: Minimally Invasive Organizing)\n\n- Start by observing the current workflow. What is use commonly, with high urgency, or often browsed.\n- Ask about preferences, try to uncover the underlying system and categories\n\n### Correcting Problematic Behavior\n\n- In scene play, not following an order is a most an annoyance. But for 24/7 servants, forgetting to pick up a child or buy food can have real world and significant consequences beyond master's displeasure.\n- No one is perfect. Account for true accidents. Set an acceptible margin for each task.\n- In general, long-term servants do not respond well to \"punishment\". They take pride and stake some of their identity on their tasks. The only time punishment makes sense is an instantaneous response to correct habitual behavior, as explicit operant conditioning.\nThe recommendations:\n  - Bring the servant's attention to the situation\n  - verify that the problem is understood\n  - Determine why the problem occurred\n  - Develop a plan for preventing this problem in the future\n  - If necessary, re-evaluate the servant's capabilities\n- When failures persist, the best approach is to durastically reduce expectations of competance, slowly build back up from there. Make the task painfully simple, add complexity only one the simple has been completely mastered\n  - For emotionally sensative servant, can help develop confidence\n  - For less emotionally sensitive, mild humiliation can be incorporated. (Use strategies for teaching children)\n  - For reluctant servants, or those who want to be forced, making the simple task monotonous will cause more complex tasks to feel like a relief.\n\n### Remedial Obedience\n\n- Some s-types could make good servants, but for one reason or another aren't ready\n  - Perhaps attached to the fantasy of the role\n  - Bad habits from past relationships/dysfunctional unbringing\n  - Some are not sufficiently mature (whatever their age)\n  - Some have poor self-control\n- It is uncommon for an normal, well-adjusted adult to require any kind of obedience training.\n- Escapist Servants:\n  - If a servant can hold a job or similar, but cannot perform in a power dynamic, it is likely because they are in a fantasy role, or see the service as an escape.\n  - It may take work to find service they can do which allows them to stay in role or doesn't feel like work\n- PTSD Servants:\n  - Expect significant effort\n  - A structured controlled training environment with a restricted role can help\n  - Slowly expand their privledges of being useful, using their own judgement, and expressing their opinion\n- Not all bad behavior can be caused by Remedial Obediance\n  - Separate bad behavior into \"misdemeanors\" and \"felonies\"\n  - Misdemeanors can be addressed with skillful training, felonies leave little hope of establishing a service relationship\n  - Misdemeanors should be responded to with a serious conversation about the reasons for their behavior and their commitment to the relationship.\n  - Misdemeanors are signs that something is fundimentally amiss.\n  - Felonies deserve a hard look at whether the relationship can continue in any sense.\n (what follows is a list of Misdemeanors and Felonies. I can't summarize it while doing it justice)\n\n### Questioning Orders and Disagreeing With Respect\n\n- In any long-lasting relationships, no matter how devotional, the servant will notice areas the have more knowledge, skill, or insight.\n- In a mature relationship, a servant is able to offer advice and contrary opinions respectfully.\n- Offering opinions /frequently/ is only for experiences and trusted servants. It is not unhealthy to restrict a right to voice opinion until earned.\n- For inexperienced and insecure servants, offering advice can create a no-win situation for the matter\n  - If they take the advice and it fails, the servant feels the master can't decide.\n  - If they don't take the advice but succeed, he servant may be sullen about being proven wrong.\n  - If they don't take the advice and it fails, the servant feels \"I told you so\" that can undermine future interactions.\n  - If they're prohibited from offering advice, they may feel abused or that the master is insecure.\n- Give feedback respectfully. State information that may have been missed. \"May I offer an alternative?\"\n- The master must always feel empowered to say no to changes and requests.\n- The master should decide if the servant's advice is a valuable tool or not, and restrict or permit it accordingly.\n- Asking for help\n  - Servants should differentiate between Emergency and Non-emergency situations with explicit language\n- Communicating Emotions\n  - One option is Strict Phrases: eg \"Yes, Sir\" for no emotion, \"If it pleases you, sir\" for dislike, \"Only if it pleases you, sir\" for distaste.\n- Accidental Orders\n  - It is good to explicitly flag orders.\n    - Master may use a specific phrase, but this is onerous.\n    - Servant always responds \"Yes, Sir\" to percieved orders, giving their master a change to intercept, is often better.\n\n### Gender and Service\n\n- Some relationships utilize traditional gender roles\n  - Can be used to punish, by assigning explicitly \"other gender\" work\n  - Can be used to reward, by assigning explicitly gender-affirming work\n  - Can be used to reinforce or breach identity\n  - May be eroticized\n  - Might be expected by s-types\n\n(what follows is a list of Good traits for Masters and Servants. I can't summarize it while doing it justice)\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-21T19:16:40.139925864Z","tags":["Draft"]},"/drafts/A-Review-of-Relating-Languages":{"title":"A Review of Relating Languages","content":"Relating Languages is a model of language between people. As an autistic person with decades of refining my masks, I find this concept fascinating. One of the problems I had, growing up, was a lack of explicit instruction about how communication works. I made a study of it, and developed a few models of my own. However, my models have always struggled to categorize the encoded aspects of communication, and that where Relating Languages shines.\n\n\u003e [!info] Draft\n\u003e\n\u003e This is a Draft. It may not comply with the site Templates. It may be renamed or moved in the future. See [[Content Lifecycle]] for more information on Drafts.\n\nIn this Review, I'm going to attempt a summary of Relating Language Overview, a free document from \u003chttps://www.relatinglanguages.com\u003e. Afterward, I'm going to dig deeper into each portion of the model, to see what is intuitive or counter intuitive for me.\n\n## Model Overview\n\n### 3 Axis of Relating Languages\n\n- **Receptive - Expressive Axis**: This axis indicates the amount of Proactivity in one's speech patterns. A Receptive communicator is more likely to be waiting for a prompt or handing over (give) turns, while an Expressive communicator is more likely to initiate conversation or take over the turn.\n- **Interactive - Didactic Axis**: This axis indicates the length of turns during an interaction. An Interactive communicator tends toward high frequency turn-taking, keeping alignment with the listener through constant checks and short feedback loops. Meanwhile a Didactic communicator tends toward longer high content turns, keeping alignment with the listener through fully explaining before handing off speaking role.\n- **External - Internal Axis**: This axis indicates how much the speaker is focusing on themselves or their listener. While not used for the Quadrants, this axis is used to differentiate the 8 base languages. Meanwhile the 4 Balanced Languages sit in the middle of this axis, balancing both sides.\n\nI definitely feel like I struggle most with the Expressive mode, of the 4 poles.\n\n### 4 Quadrants of Relating Languages\n\n- **Questioning**: A communication style focused around asking questions and fulfilling one’s curiosity.  A “Receptive and Interactive” mode, meaning short turns with explicit handovers. Keeping a balanced pace to keep engagement high.\n- **Directing**: A communication style focused around giving recommendations or orders. A “Interactive and Expressive” mode, meaning short turns with intuited handovers. Quick and concise enough to get things decided.*\n- **Storytelling**: A communication style focused around relaying information.  A “Didactic and Expressive” mode, meaning long turns with intuited handovers. Plenty of time to really sell the events while still letting others.*\n- **Observing**: A communication style focused around Receiving information.  A “Didactic and Receptive” mode, meaning long turns with explicit handovers. Plenty of time to think about what was said!\n\n\\* And here, I notice again that my lack of understanding of the Expressive mode makes it a bit more difficult to describe the benefits/considerations of Directing and Storytelling. Both are *clearly* important, equally to the others! But I really struggled to simplify them enough in my head to write those last summary sentences. The \"with intuited handovers\" feels... not quite right. Looks like some work yet to be done for me.\n\n### 3 Dialects of Relating Languages\n\n- **Balanced Dialect**: These dialects represent the highest-skill form of a Quadrant's communication style. They are the combination of an Internal and External Dialect, balancing the self-focus and other-focus aspects of those two into something which serves the needs of both participants.\n- **Internal Dialect**: Self-focused Dialects, with one for each of the Quadrants. They focus heavily on one's own motivations and interest, which can cause them to quickly lose other's interest. In Relating Languages, these are considered a bad form of communication.\n- **External Dialect**: Other-focused Dialects,\n\nThis entire section reminds me HEAVILY of [[drafts/Model of Relationship Optimization|Model of Relationship Optimization]]! Internal Dialects are a GREAT indicator of Bad Egoism, while External Dialects are a similarly great indicator of Bad Altruism.\n\nThis section is also lays out an implicit growth path for someone using Relating Languages as a learning tool. If you are good at an External Dialect, then learn the Internal Dialect and weave it into your conversation to create a Balanced Dialect. and vice versa. I love Models that treat themselves as Skills, but I usually prefer every combination of poles be a \"good skill\", where Relating Languages treats the middle of the External - Internal Axis as optimal. Not my preference but still completely functional.\n\n### 3 Questioning Dialects\n\n- **Serving**: This is the External Dialect of Questioning, the Receptive and Interactive quadrant. Serving is about learning the other person and making them feel seen.\n- **Interrogating**: This is the Internal Dialect of Questioning, the Receptive and Interactive quadrant. Interrogating is about learning what you want to know, and satisfying your own curiosity.\n- **Exploring/Inviting**:  This is the Balanced Dialect of Questioning, the Receptive and Interactive quadrant. Inviting is about balancing your desire to know with the other person's desire for validation. This Dialect is called both Exploring and Inviting in the literature.\n\n### 3 Observing Dialects\n\n- **Merging**: This is the External Dialect of Observing, the Receptive and Didactic quadrant. Merging is about fitting into the vibe, including saying whatever keeps everyone unsurprised/interrupted when prompted while keeping the focus off you, getting washed up in the thoughts of others.\n- **Withdrawing**: This is the Internal Dialect of Observing, the Receptive and Didactic quadrant. Withdrawing is about disengaging and staying aloof, keeping your reactions to yourself so as not to disrupt, and focusing on your own thoughts.\n- **Partaking**:  This is the Balanced Dialect of Observing, the Receptive and Didactic quadrant. Partaking is about being present and observant, ready to comment when the time is right with no pressure to do so, hearing others without losing track of your own opinions and voice.\n\n### 3 Storytelling Dialects\n\n- **Performing**: This is the External Dialect of Storytelling, the Expressive and Didactic quadrant. Performing is about watching the reactions of others as you speak, trying to keep their focus and engagement, even to the point of altering your message/story.\n- **Informing**: This is the Internal Dialect of Storytelling, the Expressive and Didactic quadrant. Informing is about completely and fully expressing yourself and making Sure that others understand.\n- **Conveying**:  This is the Balanced Dialect of Storytelling, the Expressive and Didactic quadrant. Conveying is about being able to fully get across the information you need, the full story, without\n\n### 3 Directing Dialects\n\n- **Suggesting**: This is the External Dialect of Interactive, the Expressive and Interactive quadrant. Suggesting is about applying the minimum pressure while still inviting others to change.\n- **Commanding**: This is the Internal Dialect of Interactive, the Expressive and Interactive quadrant. Commanding is about applying the maximum of pressure, often from a personal desire standpoint, in order to get someone to change.\n- **Conducting**:  This is the Balanced Dialect of Interactive, the Expressive and Interactive quadrant. Conducting is about being clear with your desires, while leaving room for counter-offers, contributions, and collaboration.\n\n### Secondary Model: 3 Language Niche\n\nThe 3 Language Niche are mentioned in amore offhand way in the Overview document, and are not a core lens of the model.\n\n- **Safety Language**: The Quadrant or Dialects you use around friends and in safe places.  What you Default to when not intentionally masking. Your [[drafts/Genuine vs Authentic|Genuine]] Language.\n- **Stress Language**: The Quadrant or Dialects you use when threatened or unsafe. What you Default to when under strain or in high Noradrenaline states.\n- **Social Language**: \"Change depending on the context of the group.\" It's a bit unclear from the document what Social Language means.\n\nMy best guess is that Social Language means your [[drafts/Genuine vs Authentic|Authentic]] mode of speaking, the kind you are trying out or learning.  But I could be completely off base\n\n## Review\n\n### Overall\n\nI love this model, and will likely be using a modified form of it going forward for my Mental Health Coaching. It has incredible documentation already, which makes it useful as a starting point when trying to establish common terms with someone.\n\n### Another Pill for Typical Mind Fallacy\n\nOne of the biggest problems I see people running into is small scale [Typical Mind Fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/typical-mind-fallacy).  The way this plays out is one person has a limited amount of communication experience and assumes that experience is the default.  Other people start to look like \"broken\" versions of themself... which is a rather anti-social lens to use.\n\nRelating Languages provides an alternate lens: there are many Dialects people use when Relating to others! Treating your preferred version as either perfect or the only option is a recipe for misunderstanding.  It's three axis represent the different ways preferences people have for their speech: how long are the turns, how are they passed, and who is the focus.\n\nBy learning the sheer variety of ways others talk, you can start to educate yourself about [[drafts/Normal is who you meet|what is Normal]]. By watching people use a different speaking mode, you can dismantle your assumptions about effective communication and see the broader field of options.  By looking internally, you can find what skills you lack and develop a practice plan for growth.\n\n### Expressive-Receptive Axis and the hidden Speaker-Listener skill Axis\n\nThis section relies on an assumption.  The assumption is this: \"You should attempt to use the same Dialect as your speaking partner by default.\"  To be clear, this assumption is not explicitly stated by the Relating Languages Overview!  There are hints of it though: the name [dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect) itself implies that different Relating Languages are \"mutually intelligible\", but as someone who has moved around a lot I can tell you that mirroring the local dialect always helps smooth communication.\n\nTo be clear, this might not be the author's intent at all.  This might be me smuggling in a concept from Color Model and assuming it applies here.  Still, if we go forward with that assumption, that two people using the same RL Dialect will communicate better than those using two different Dialects... we hit on an interesting problem.  It seems like the authors themselves tend to conflate Expressive with Speaking and Receptive with Listening... when there are fairly obvious skillsets around \"Expressive Listening\" and \"Receptive Speaking\".\n\nFor example, based on their descriptions, RL would expect a Storytelling communicator to want an Observing Audience. All of the words used for Storytelling seem to imply they're the center of attention, constantly talking, while the wording of Observing implies active listening with few words said. But that breaks with the concept of Mirroring Dialect; couldn't a Storyteller want a Storytelling audience?\n\nLets dig into that. A Storyteller is taking their long turn, spelling out the major events of the story... while the audience does what? If the Audience is made up Observers, they will be silent and listen until the end. That doesn't sound like a very Expressive interaction! Expressive interactions are supposed to have people taking over the turn informally!\n\nIn my experience, what a group of Storytellers actually do is have one tell their story while others chime in with extra little details, asides, and quirks. Never quite interrupting the primary flow, but instead adding to it quickly. The audience certainly isn't SILENT. Mirroring the speaker's Storytelling energy involves adding in!\n\nTo me, it's just obvious that Storytelling(and the other quadrants) involve TWO SKILLS. There is the Storytelling Speaker, and there is the Storytelling Listener. The Storytelling speaker expects and allows for interruptions, despite the long turns, and the Storytelling listener expects to be able to add on even while listening. A crowd of Storytellers create a story cooperatively, despite having one lead. It might even be a faux pas to /not/ interact with the story in any way, to be a complete Observer with nothing to say, no banter to contribute. (Can you tell I've made this mistake before?)\n\nI think the model could use this additional Speaker-Listener axis, although I can understand it being missing from the overview. It would add a fourth dimension, and that's just too much for more people to use when they're just learning a new model!  Starting with less axis is good... but having the option of finer-grained analysis and skills is also good.  \n\nAs a personal example, I'm quite good at \"Directing\"... as a listener. I know how to accept suggestions and respond to them without giving suggestions in return. And that skill has not made me *any* better at Directing as a speaker, something I'm not rapidly trying to learn because of my new job role.  Knowing the difference helps me isolate what skills I need to practice.\n\n### External-Internal Axis and BDSM\n\nWhat I find most interesting about the External-Internal Axis and how the poles of each map near-perfectly to BDSM speech expectations.  Yes, Balanced Dialect is framed (correctly) as the standard for the vast majority of interactions. Egalitarian communication is the default culture and Balanced Dialects match those expectations perfects. But the poles of the External-Internal Axis so accurately map to \"Dom\" and \"Sub\" communication tropes that you could use them as a guide.  Given the author notes BDSM as a source of inspiration, I'm certain this is not a mistake in the model, but it still tickles me to see.\n\nIt's to the point that I would honestly consider Relating Languages as a follow-up to [[drafts/A Review of Real Service|Real Service]] for people looking to have long running Relationship Dynamics.  And definitely for Polyamorous people who need to be able to switch Dialect based on which partner they're talking with.\n\n#### The \"Good\" Dialects of Relating Languages\n\n- Exploring: Egalitarian way of questioning.\n- Partaking: Egalitarian way of observing.\n- Conveying: Egalitarian way of storytelling.\n- Conducting: Egalitarian way of directing.\n\n#### The \"Bad\" Dialects of Relating Languages\n\n- Interrogating: Dom way of questioning.\n- Withdrawing: Dom way of observing.\n- Informing: Dom way of storytelling.\n- Commanding: Dom way of directing.\n\n- Serving: Sub way of questioning.\n- Merging: Sub way of observing.\n- Performing: Sub way of storytelling.\n- Suggesting: Sub way of directing.\n\n### Color Model and Relating Languages\n\nTo open, I don't think that Color Model and Relating Languages map one to one. The way I think of it, during the listening Process, Relating Languages happen a bit before the Color Model during decoding. Relating Languages are more around how the message is framed and presented, Color Model is more about what internal representations are used as message content. Another way to say it is that RL is a bit more to the Syntax side while Color Model is a bit more to the Semantics side.\n\nBecause of this, I don't think there's any reason to believe that, say, Yellow Thinkers are automatically better at Commanding Dialect. Hypothetically, the two should be completely independent. That said, reviewing my experiences, there is some overlap or association between the two. Keep in mind, I'm writing this having only been introduced to RL 24 hours ago, so these associations are built from an intuitive understanding of RL and not time-honed practice with it.\n\n- **Yellow** (External Thinking): I most associate Yellow with Interrogating and Commanding, making them fit into the Interactive Internal axis of RL. Yellow wants to efficiently understand, correct, and move on. Internally, this feels like optimizing toward a goal or end state.\n- **Pink** (External Feeling): I most associate Pink with Suggesting and Serving, making them fit into the Interactive External axis of RL. Pink wants to gently push everyone into a comfortable and cooperative state. It could be that most Pink people I interact with simply prefer slower paced communication styles! This makes them the RL External opposite to Yellow!\n- **Red** (External Sensing): I most associate with Performing and Merging, making them fit into External Didactic axis of RL. Red wants to show off for others and fit in with the crowd, looking for predictability in hierarchy while using symbols to establish roles/relationships.\n- **Orange** (External Intuiting): I most associate with Interrogating and Informing, making them not quite fit in RL, although both Dialects are Internal. Orange wants to deeply understand the world, and to share the models it forms via that curiosity. It's Storytelling is non-linear, but no less Expressive for it.\n- **Blue** (Internal Thinking):  I most associate with Informing and Withdrawing, making them fit into the Didactic Internal axis of RL. Blue wants to take a step back and see the truth from a distance, then explain that truth as a third party.\n- **Purple** (Internal Feeling):  I most associate with Merging and Storytelling, making them fit into the Didactic External axis of RL. Purple wants to stoke passion in themself and others, expressing their emotions and feeling others deeply. This makes them the RL External opposite of Blue!\n- **Indigo** (Internal Sensing):  I most associate with Merging and Withdrawing, making them fit into the Observing Quadrant of RL. Indigo wants to be embodied in the present moment with no discomfort, and ideally achieve that state for everyone around them.\n- **Green** (Internal Intuiting):  I most associate with Performing and Informing, making them fit into the Storytelling Quadrant of RL. Green wants to see deeply into the past and future, and working with those long chains of logic often causes them to use Storytelling of both types.\n\nIt would seem my personal experience with Color model doesn't quite match Colors and RL Dialects! It's surprisingly close though! It seems I don't encounter too many people using the Interactive Dialects, since they're under-represented in my mapping.\n\nAlso interesting that the Socionics Internal/External Axis does not match to RL's Internal External Axis. I think that the Socionics axis actually maps more closely to the proposed Speaker/Listener axis! For example, Yellow is not just Commanding in my experience, but mostly Commanding Speaker. Yellow is often very bad at listening to Commands, and engages in Competitive Honing of skills, challenging other to prove they're more efficient and only giving once they've been proven wrong! Two Yellow people interacting looks like two Commanding Speakers trying to steal eachother's spotlight, while Interrogating eachother!\n\nSimilarly, Green people love listening to stories, while Red people love speaking those stories. Blue love listening to the facts more than speaking, Purple spend a good amount of time in their own emotional state and listening to that of others. But of course, as people grow in their skills these sorts of preferences wash out into a more varied holistic approach. Whether that's the influence of exposure to other Colors or to other RL, it's clear that both system are made of skills with no one pattern of growth.\n\nUltimately, I think this analysis underlines that the two models are made of mostly independent axis. I'd need far more evidence to make any strong claims about a correlation between a Color and a Dialect. Which is, to me, a wonderful thing because it means I can use the two together, synergistically! Now if only I had the working memory to hold all these axes!\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-21T19:16:40.139925864Z","tags":["Draft"]},"/drafts/Compute-Analogy-of-Plurality":{"title":"Compute Analogy of Plurality","content":"\u003e [!info] Draft\n\u003e\n\u003e This is a Draft.

It's a field, with some being more acceptable, and some limit of \"no longer acceptible\". Different people have different Space-following behavior.\nThe resulting presentation of self is a gestalt between all 3 influences, and constantly changes as each of the three change.\n\n# Derived Concepts\n\n- Genuine Emotions are what you actually feel. Coping mechanics are used to preserve the Authentic Self when those emotions don't fit it. Bottling is common, while emotional reprocessing (turning anxiety into excitement, etc) is higher skill.\n- The Genuine Self is pulled toward the Social Self-space and toward the Authentic Self during interactions.\n- Plurality is the upkeep of multiple distinct Authentic Self.\n- Authentic Self can be considered Persona, and can become architypal.\n- Different conversational partners and settings subtly change the Social Self-space, both the boundaries and the optimal point.\n- Masking is hiding the Genuine Self.\n  - This is distinct from the natural pull of the Genuine Self toward the Authentic\n  - Masking an emotion involves completely replacing it, faking a different one rather than building on or reinterpreting the Genuine one\n  - Social Chameleon are pulled very strongly by the Social self-space\n- Most Identity disorders relate to the Genuine Self.\n- Sometimes, your Genuine Self is far from the Social Self-space, requiring a lot of effort. This may be fixable or not.\n  - The Axis of Oppression detail ways the Social Self-space uses unchangeable facets of a person.\n- Trauma are habits which don't shift away in new context when they are no longer relevant. These create a difficult to resolve gap between Genuine and Authentic self, where the Authentic wants to be well-fit to the situation but the Genuine does not update, requiring additional spoons.\n\n# Skill States\n\n| State | Genuine | Authentic | Space-following |\n| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |\n| Healthy | Balanced | Balanced | Balanced |\n| Identity Disorders | Weak | Balanced | Balanced |\n| Social Anxiety | Balanced | Weak | Balanced |\n| \"Weird\" | Balanced | Balanced | Weak |\n|  | Strong | Balanced | Balanced |\n| Feeling constrained by your role | Balanced | Strong | Balanced |\n| Involuntary Social Chameleon | Balanced | Balanced | Strong |\n\n#draft\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-21T19:16:40.139925864Z","tags":["Draft"]},"/drafts/Ideaspace-and-Words":{"title":"Ideaspace and Words","content":"\u003e [!info] Draft\n\u003e\n\u003e This is a Draft.

Ideaspace treats ideas as literal territory to be navigated.

They are placed in the most obvious locations. By analogy, on the tallest cliff point of the tallest cliff, visible for miles in all directions.\n\nProfessionals still need to know these First Order words, to assist with onboarding. Since these words are so heavily used, they often deserve significant study and optimization.

Unlike with First Order words, there might not be any notable landmark associated with Second Order words. These words are often found by a sort of communal factor analysis, finding what concepts are used most often by those working in the space and naming them. By analogy, these are the \"local pub\", where any local knows where you mean but foreigners would not.\n\n## Inner Transition connections\n\nThese are well worn paths used to navigate from First Order words to Second Order words. They often take the form of [[patterns/Pattern Page]], describing a problem with the First Order word and how to derive the Second Order solution. By analogy, these are the paths that locals travel to meet foreigners.\n\n## Second Order connections\n\nThese are the connections between Second Order words. In a newly explored area, there will be few of these, with most connections being Inner Transition. But as a field becomes better known, the Second Order connections with become more numerous and well established. By analogy, these are the hunting trails that slowly become the local roads.\n\n## Outer Transition connections\n\nThese are the connections from Second Order words in one locale to another. They represent non-intuitive connections between ideaspaces, things that only experts of one or the other field could find. Outer Transitions are the most common way for new First Order words to be discovered. By analogy, these are the secret or rarely used trails between settlements.\n\n## Third Order words\n\nThird Order words can also be thought of as a subsection of Second Order. They are words which have no direct connection to First Order words. These are often called Jargon, words which can only be explained in terms of concepts which are, themself, difficult to understand for an outside. Attempting to explain them often results in [[h1/Sazen]]. By analogy, these are the hidden old shack that's out in the woods with no obvious path, but everyone knows its out there and talks about it sometimes.\n\n#draft\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-21T19:16:40.139925864Z","tags":["Draft"]},"/drafts/Information-Security-Policy":{"title":"Information Security Policy","content":"A semi-outline of how we personally treat information, and how we prefer our information be treated.\n\n\u003e [!info] Draft\n\u003e\n\u003e This is a Draft.

EG, X is a Toxic Interaction if it harmed both parties, or Y is a Parasitic Trait if it benefits only one person.\n\n## Model Overview\n\n### 2 Variables of Relationship\n\n- **Self Axis**: A relationship can be either good for you, or bad for you.\n- **Other Axis**: A relationship can be either good for you partner, or bad for your partner\n\n### 4 Types of Relationship\n\n- **Symbiotic**: Relationships/interactions/traits that are Mutually Beneficial. They are good for both partners.\n- **Parasitic**: Relationships/interactions/traits that have a One-sided Benefit for you. You gain from them, but your partner is harmed.\n- **Charity**: Relationships/interactions/traits that have a One-sided Benefit for the partner. Your partner gains from them, but you are harmed.\n- **Toxic**: Relationships/interactions/traits that are Mutually Detrimental. They harm both participants.\n\n### 2 methods of altering a relationship\n\n- **Altruistic**: Optimizing for the benefit of your partner. This involves changing parts of the interaction to make it better for your partners, such as by avoiding boundaries or by bringing utility.\n  - Ideal Altruism benefits your partner at no cost to you.\n  - Good Altruism benefits your partner more than it harms you, thus bringing the relationship closer to mutual benefit. It shifts the relationship toward Symbiotic and Charity.\n  - Bad Altruism, AKA Martyrdom, harms you more than it benefits your partner. It shifts the relationship toward Charity and Toxic.\n- **Egoistic**: Optimizing for your benefit. This involves changing parts of the interaction for that it's better for you, such as changing your form of payment.\n  - Ideal Egoism benefits you at not cost to your partner.\n  - Good Egoism benefits you more than it harms your partner, thus bringing the relationship closer to mutual benefit. It shifts the relationship toward Symbiotic and Parasitic.\n  - Bad Egoism, AKA Narcissism, harms your partner more than it benefits you. It shifts the relationship toward Parasitic and Toxic.\n\n### 4 methods of Relationship Optimization\n\n- **Promote Good Altruism**: Look for cases where your Skills make it easy to help your partner, or where their Skill perfectly solve a your desires. Encourage asking eachother for help where the other person is strong or experienced, where a little bit of effort from them will save you a ton of time.\n- **Avoid Bad Altruism**: Look for cases where you or your partner are using Skills that you're bad at \"for eachother\". Think about where you feel \"forced\" to do something for your partner, or vice versa. These should be reduced without any shame. Everyone is unique in their skills and their lack of skill, and relationships flourish on good trades, not bad ones.\n- **Promote Good Egoism**: Be honest about what you really Want and Benefit from, and check what your partners Wants and Benefits from. Make sure you get those wants met, and that they do the same. It is important to be your own advocate, as you ultimately generally know what you Want best.\n- **Avoid Bad Egoism**: Look for cases where you or your partner are asking for things you can't provide, or which mean little to them. This often looks like Bad Service with low [[drafts/A Review of Real Service#Annoyance Factor|Annoyance Factor]], where your partner forgets that you do it (because it doesn't matter to them) while you're putting effort in.\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-21T19:16:40.139925864Z","tags":["Draft"]},"/drafts/Normal-is-who-you-meet":{"title":"Normal is who you meet","content":"\n\"Normal is who you meet\" means that a person's concept of normality is determined by the amount of variety in their experiences.\n\n\u003e [!info] Draft\n\u003e\n\u003e This is a Draft.

All sorts of people use the bus, from many walks of life, philosophies, ways of socializing, ways of relaxing.

People with a thin concept of normal are more prone to [Typical Mind Fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/typical-mind-fallacy), tending to assume that others are broken versions of themself rather than completely functional humans in a different mode.

multiple close relationships at once.\n\n# Related Outlines\n\n(List of nearby ideaspaces, should only link to other Outline)\n\n# Entry Concepts\n\n- **Polyamory**: A subset of Ethical Non-Monogamy where all partners are allowed to seek out multiple loving relationships.\n- **Compersion**: Happiness at a Partner's Happiness.  Opposite of Jealousy, Unhappiuness at a Partner's Happiness.\n- **Polycule**: A network of interconnected relationships between 3 or more adults.\n\n# Outline\n\n## General Terms\n\n- **Partner**: General term for one who you have a relationship with.\n- **Metamour**: The partner of your partner (who is not your direct partner).\n\n## Emotions\n\n- **New Relationship Energy (NRE)**: the rush of emotions that come from a brand new relationship, which last during the period of discovery, but tend to trail off over time.\n- **Established Relationship Energy (ERE)**: the comfortable and stable feelings that come from a long-running relationship, which tend to build over time.  Often the deciding factor for \"Primary\" relationship status.\n- **Friends with benefits**: Relationships that involve both Sexual and Emotional energies, but not Romantic (or perhaps not \"long term\").  Often used for relationship that lack NRE and ERE\n- **Polysaturated**: Feeling like you have *enough* partners or that your relationship needs are met\n\n## Relationship Structure Stereotypes\n\n- **Closed Polycule**: A group of 3 or more adults who have no relationships outside of the group\n- **Open Polycule**: A group of 3 or more adults who are connected by relationships and who are free to pursue additional relationships\n\n## Information Sharing Expectations\n\n- **Lap-Sitting Polyamory**: A form of Polyamory in which metamours distincts are very small.  \"Your partner is someone I can touch too.\"\n- **Kitchen Table Polyamory**: A form of Polyamory where two partners have other relationships in full view of eachother. When partners expect to interact with metamours in non-formal settings\n- **Garden Party Polyamory**: a middleground between kitchen table and parallel polyamory.  When partners expect to interact with metamours in only formal settings.\n- **Parallel Polyamory**: A form of Polyamory where two partners have other relationships independantly.  When partners expect not to interact with metamours at all.\n- **Don't Ask, Don't Tell**: Consensual Polyamory in which two partners are allowed to have other relationships so long as they don't talk about them.  For when partners expect to /not even know if metamours exist/.\n\n## Individal Relationship Stereotypes\n\n- **Fluid Bonding**: Not using barriers for sexual activities (usually meaning penetrative sex) in the relationship.  While this level of intimacy is important in monogamy too, it takes on a different importance for Poly due to the danger of spreading STDs through polycule.\n- **Nesting Partner**: Partner(s) with whom you live.  Co-living involves a large amount of communication and coordination which can often give relationships a new dimension and meaning to a person.\n\n## Relationship Heirarchy Terms\n\nSome Polyamorous people use Heirarchical terms to sort their relationships.  Not to be confused with \"Heirarchical Relationships\", which are more the realm of BDSM.\n\n- **Primary Partner**: The \"most important\" relationship a polyamorous person has, often denotes the presence of \"Established Relationship Energy\".  Sometimes called Anchor Partner.\n- **Secondary Partner**: Non-primary partners who are still close.\n- **Tertiary Partner**: no universal definition, rarely used.  When used, generally used FWB or similar.  That said, ask the person for clarificaiton if needed.\n- **Non-Hierarchical Relationships**: Having a egalitarian/equal stance to all of one's relationships, often as a philosophical stance\n- **Relationship Anarchy**: Not defining/experiencing heirarchy of relationships, or not putting terms on relationships.\n- **Chosen Family**: Having familial roles/relationships to non-blood.  Also called \"Poly Family\"\n- **Solo Polyamory**: an individual who is poly \"by themself\".  Oftens means having no Nesting Partners or having no Primary Partners.\n\n## Situational Terms\n\n- **Telemour**: partner of one's Metamour.  Generally unnecessary, but can be useful when explaining the far reachs of one's polycule.\n- **Veto**: In the context of poly, the right for one's partner to \"veto\" a new relationship.  Generally reserved for Primary partners.\n- **Relationship Orientation**: The idea that Monoamory:Polyamory::Straight:Gay.  That Polyamory is an orientation that a person can be more or less oriented toward.\n\n# Expert Connections\n\n(Ideal: List of non-intuitive connections between this ideaspace and others, generally doesn't link to other Outlines)\n\n- Connection to Egalitarian Relationships\n- Connection to Relationship Dynamics\n- Connection to Child Raising\n- Connection to Consent and Boundaries\n\n#Outline #Quality-1\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-21T19:16:40.139925864Z","tags":["Outline"]},"/outlines/Page-Templates":{"title":"Outline of Page Templates","content":"Templates are premade guidelines for how to format content on this site.

It's an important Lens by which to analyze the world... but it's standalone, meaning it's hard to explain the word via comparisons to other concepts.  And it doesn't solve a particular problem.

They rarely revisit prior work to enhance it. Users, similarly, rarely revisit the majority of their consumed Content because it loses relevance quickly. In order to produce content that remains relevant, a shift in topic and mindset around content creation is needed, as well as practice with the skill of Refinement.\n\n# Problem\n\nContent has a half-life of [[drafts/Relevance]] so short that it is forgotten by both Creator and reader within weeks.\n\n# Story\n\nFor decades, we've been taking constant notes and attempting to distill useful thought patterns to share with friends.

You must also revisit that content and, ideally, make it better when you do. If you don't find yourself revisiting a page (even if only to link it to someone else), then it must have lost [[drafts/Relevance]].\n\nHow can you make sure a page is revisited?  To start, Highlight Ideas. Short Content is often framed around a particular event or product. But events fade into the distances, and it become unclear if the content has anything worth saying in the new present. Some content creators try to balance this, using a particular event or product to frame discussion of the larger issue, but because the event or product take up [[Search Length]], the content still suffers from reduced searchability over time.\n\n## Long Content is Refined\n\nIt is incredibly rare for Content to be complete and definitive for more than a few years, even when designed to be so. Most Content is neither complete nor definitive, ever. Long Content is no different.\n\nTherefore, treat every piece of content as a draft. When it is revisited, either by the Creator or the Reader, it will be checked for continued relevance and correctness. Use feedback to improve and expand the content, updating its relevance and often raising it beyond its previous relevance.\n\n# Resulting Context\n\n- Writer creates pages that will remain relevant, even if they are not \"finished\" nor \"definitive\"\n- Writer refines their pages over time, resulting in increasing relevance over time rather than decreasing\n\n# Instances\n\n- Gwern's [Long Content](https://gwern.net/about#long-content)  - where I first encountered the concept\n- This Site\n\n#Pattern #Quality-2\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-21T19:16:40.139925864Z","tags":["Pattern"]},"/patterns/Outline-Page":{"title":"Outline Page","content":"# Patlet\n\nWhen attempting to learn a new area of knowledge, it can be difficult to know how to proceed.
