Intuition Distance becomes physical distance, Notability becomes regonal landmarks\n\n# First Order words\nThese are the words that allow a novice to locate the ideaspace.  They are placed in the most obvious locations.  By analogy, on the tallest cliff point of the tallest cliff, visible for miles in all directions.\n\nProfessionals still need to know these First Order words, to assist with onboarding.  Since these words are so heavily used, they often deserve significant study and optimization.  By analogy, the cave just a minute away from the tallest cliff, a place you'd /actually/ come to the area to visit.\n\n## First Order connections\nThese are connections used to navigate between specialist concept areas\n\n# Second Order words\nProfessionals don't just need to locate the ideaspace, they need to navigate it.  Unlike with First Order words, there might not be any notable landmark associated with Second Order words. These words are often found by a sort of communal factor analysis, finding what concepts are used most often by those working in the space and naming them.  By analogy, these are the \"local pub\", where any local knows where you mean but foreigners would not.\n\n## Inner Transition connections\nThese are well worn paths used to navigate from First Order words to Second Order words.  They often take the form of [[tags/Pattern]], describing a problem with the First Order word and how to derive the Second Order solution.  By analogy, these are the paths that locals travel to meet foreigners.\n\n## Second Order connections\nThese are the connections between Second Order words.  In a newly explored area, there will be few of these, with most connections being Inner Transition.  But as a field becomes better known, the Second Order connections with become more numerous and well established.  By analogy, these are the hunting trails that slowly become the local roads.\n\n## Outer Transition connections\nThese are the connections from Second Order words in one locale to another.  They represent non-intuitive connections between ideaspaces, things that only experts of one or the other field could find.  Outer Transitions are the most common way for new First Order words to be discovered.  By analogy, these are the secret or rarely used trails between settlements.\n\n## Third Order words\nThird Order words can also be thought of as a subsection of Second Order.  They are words which have no direct connection to First Order words.  These are often called Jargon, words which can only be explained in terms of concepts which are, themself, difficult to understand for an outside. By analogy, these are the hidden old shack that's out in the woods with no obvious path, but everyone knows its out there and talks about it sometimes.\n\n#draft","lastmodified":"2023-04-23T16:54:45.629011318Z","tags":[]},"/drafts/Intuitive-Distance-and-Creation":{"title":"Intuitive Distance and Creation","content":"Intuitive Distance between Creator and Reader is always a careful thing to balance.

They rarely revisit prior work to enhance it.  Users, similarly, rarely revisit the majority of their consumed Content because it loses relevance quickly. In order to produce content that remains relevant, a shift in topic and mindset around content creation is needed, as well as practice with the skill of Refinement.\n\n# Problem\nContent has a half-life of [[drafts/Relevance]] so short that it is forgotten by both Creator and reader within weeks.\n\n# Story\nFor decades, we've been taking constant notes and attempting to distill useful thought patterns to share with friends.  However, our attempts to share that content consistently fail, in that the completed product\n\n# Context\n- Creator wants to create content which remains useful over a long period of time\n- Readers want content which sticks with them and can be revisited\n\n# Forces\n- The Creator exists in a culture of monetizable Short Content and draws heavily from that style.\n- The Creator finds their content quickly degrade in usefulness\n- The Creator is only skilled at Creating, but not Refining\n\n# Solution\nIntentionally Create and Refine Long Content\n\n## Long Content is Revisited\nTo create Long Content, it's not enough to center your content on ideas.  You must also revisit that content and, ideally, make it better when you do.  If you don't find yourself revisiting a page (even if only to link it to someone else), then it must have lost [[drafts/Relevance]].\n\nHow can you make sure a page is revisited?  To start, Highlight Ideas. Short Content is often framed around a particular event or product.  But events fade into the distances, and it become unclear if the content has anything worth saying in the new present.  Some content creators try to balance this, using a particular event or product to frame discussion of the larger issue, but because the event or product take up [[Search Length]], the content still suffers from reduced searchability over time.\n\n## Long Content is Refined\nIt is incredibly rare for Content to be complete and definitive for more than a few years, even when designed to be so.  Most Content is neither complete nor definitive, ever.  Long Content is no different.\n\nTherefore, treat every piece of content as a draft.  When it is revisited, either by the Creator or the Reader, it will be checked for continued relevance and correctness.  Use feedback to improve and expand the content, updating its relevance and often raising it beyond its previous relevance.\n\n# Resulting Context\n- Writer creates pages that will remain relevant, even if they are not \"finished\" nor \"definitive\"\n- Writer refines their pages over time, resulting in increasing relevance over time rather than decreasing\n\n# Instances\n- Gwern's [Long Content](https://gwern.net/about#long-content)  - where I first encountered the concept\n- This Site\n\n#Pattern ","lastmodified":"2023-04-23T16:54:45.629011318Z","tags":["Pattern"]},"/notes/callouts":{"title":"Callouts","content":"\n## Callout support\n\nQuartz supports the same Admonition-callout syntax as Obsidian.\n\nThis includes\n- 12 Distinct callout types (each with several aliases)\n- Collapsable callouts\n\nSee [documentation on supported types and syntax here](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts).\n\n## Showcase\n\n\u003e [!EXAMPLE] Examples\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: example\n\n\u003e [!note] Notes\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: note\n\n\u003e [!abstract] Summaries \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: abstract, summary, tldr\n\n\u003e [!info] Info \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: info, todo\n\n\u003e [!tip] Hint \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: tip, hint, important\n\n\u003e [!success] Success \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: success, check, done\n\n\u003e [!question] Question \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: question, help, faq\n\n\u003e [!warning] Warning \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: warning, caution, attention\n\n\u003e [!failure] Failure \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: failure, fail, missing\n\n\u003e [!danger] Error\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: danger, error\n\n\u003e [!bug] Bug\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: bug\n\n\u003e [!quote] Quote\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: quote, cite\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-23T16:54:45.629011318Z","tags":[]},"/site-Ideas":{"title":"site Ideas","content":"\n- Add a markdown linter\n- Add a prose linter\n- Add a documentation linter\n- Change TOC to include h1 through h3","lastmodified":"2023-04-23T16:54:45.629011318Z","tags":[]},"/tag-Ideas":{"title":"tag Ideas","content":"\n- make one for each of the [[notes/Divio Documentation]] options\n\t- Make sure they're [Long Content](https://gwern.net/about#long-content) worthy\n- Do we want one for How-To besides Pattern?
